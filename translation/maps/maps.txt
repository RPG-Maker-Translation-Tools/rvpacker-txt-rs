It's hard to make sure of the cause of death. There's not much\nphysical trauma present. Maybe he suffered a heart attack or\ndied because of some other diseases or poison?
The body has nothing of value. Seems like he's been scavenged\nthoroughly already.
You don't have enough sanity to perform this rite.

\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"The boys are training. Something at the city really shook Tanaka \nup. He insisted that Marcoh would show him some moves."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Apparently Marcoh is an amateur boxer! I mean he does look the\npart, but... I thought he felt more gentle. Roughing up people in\na ring sounds pretty violent."

\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"I couldn't help but notice your accent, you are from the old\ncountry of Oldegård, aren't you?"
"That's right."
"I'm surprised you recognize the accent."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"It always gives me such a warm feeling to hear the accent of \nthe good and honest people of the north."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"Oh I certainly do. The language has a special place in my heart."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"You see my family roots come from Oldegård as well. My \ngrandfather used to talk to me in his mother tongue when I was\njust a small child."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"I'm one quarter Oldegårdian that is. I can understand the language\nperfectly well, although my speech might not be quite as fluent\nI'm afraid."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"During my younger years, I visited the country a dozen times, but\nit has been way too long since my last trip there."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"The green valleys, the endless forests and the thousand lakes\ncall me."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"Maybe after my current business trip I will finally settle down\nthere and enjoy the long snowy winters and the bright summer nights\nwhen the sun never sets."
"You're making me homesick as well."
"Where are you from then, if not from Oldegård?"
"I thought there was something familiar about your looks!"
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"Ha ha, it must be in our genes then. The northern wind summons\nus no matter where we travel."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"I've lived a full nomad life all my time. Travelling from one \ncountry to another."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"It is almost like a family tradition at this point. We have always\nbeen on the road for generations."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"But I wanted that tradition to stop at me. My two children live\nwith their mother in Valland. I do not consider it my home country\nper se, but I suppose that is the closest to one I got."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"In any case, I do want my children to have some sense of stability.\nMaybe it's time I take them see their roots to Oldegård."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"Oh you humble me with your words. To say such a thing is the \nhighest compliment you could give me."

\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"What we are experiencing is the afterlife. Or the purgatory..."

"'We're all dead' theory sounds eerily plausible..."

\>\i[71]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"Bremen army, huh? Shouldn't the war be over already?"

Looks like he died because of his injuries...
A suitcase is left here without supervision.
Anyone could steal it!
Nothing interesting in the news paper...
The door to the previous cabin is locked from the other side.
Looking through the window, the cabin seems pitch black...
You can see a misty forest from the tainted window.
The man seems to be sleeping heavily...
"Excuse me..."
Leave him be
\>\i[76]\}AN IN A FINE SUIT\{\<\n*Snore* *Snore*
No reaction. Still deep in a sleep.
"Wake up!"
\>\i[76]\}AN IN A FINE SUIT\{\<\n"..."
No reaction.
You read his mind...\n\c[1]"Cocaine... Wine... Hookers..."\c[0]
He appears to be dreaming and that's why you can't get a clear\nimage of his thoughts.
These seats are perfectly suited for resting. You just need to\nclear out all the papers out of the way first...
You find a \c[2]Combat manual\c[0] and \c[2]Prehevil map\c[0]!
The seats here look wide enough for you to take a rest...
But you should probably check your surroundings first.
You recognize this man!
He is Caligura, also known as the "Count Dragul". One of the \ncaporegime, or captains, from a rival branch in The Family.
You have no idea what he is doing here though.
Could he be on to you?
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"The fuck do you want?"
"What's your problem?"
The man just keeps looking directly at you without saying a word...
You are not sure whether he recognize you or not...
He doesn't say a word, but you can see his expression getting angrier...
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"The fuck is this!?"
You absorbed the \c[2]Decrepit soul\c[0].
\>\i[76]\}AN IN A FINE SUIT\{\<\n"The fuck do you want?"
\>\i[76]\}AN IN A FINE SUIT\{\<\n"The fuck is this!?"
You read his mind...\n\c[1]"Why does this asshole look familiar...?"\c[0]
You read his mind...\n\c[1]"This one pisses me off. It's not enough that I got stuck here\nwith these bastards in the middle of nowhere?"\c[0]
You read his mind...\n\c[1]"Now they are even trying to strike small talk with me!?"\c[0]
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"..."
"A weird situation we're in, right?"
His expression just keeps getting more grim...
You read his mind...\n\c[1]"I know I've seen him before... But where?"\c[0]
You read his mind...\n\c[1]"Don't tell me he's someone from The Family...? Or the cops?"\c[0]
You read his mind...\n\c[1]"I swear... One more word from this asshat..."\c[0]
\>\i[76]\}AN IN A FINE SUIT\{\<\n"That fucking does it."
These seats are perfectly suited for resting. You just need to\nclear out all the books and papers out of the way first...
Something draws you towards these seats...
These seats are perfectly suited for resting if only this\nmystery man didn't stand right next to it...
Someone has left a book here...
You should probably check your surroundings first.
The man in the suit is talking to himself.
He seems to be completely lost in his own thoughts...
\>\i[81]\}ALARYMAN\{\<\n"I'm late already, so late..."
You read his mind...\n\c[1]"How am I going to explain this? This trip was a bad idea from the\nstart."\c[0]
The ropes... They are loose now for no apparent reason.
You are free.
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"The sleepy one."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"My story? You gotta be more specific. I'm too complicated for just\na few lines of dialogue."
"Are you going to stay and wait here?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"It's my hometown. I'm originally from Prehevil."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"But I'd never admit it in a conversation that I was from such\na depressing and godforsaken small town."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"So you'll only make yourself look stupid if you go spreading the\nword."
"It's my hometown as well."
"Where are you returning from?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Cool! Let's just both keep quiet about it. We don't want to look\nlike banjo-playing yokels in this crowd."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"From studies..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"I've been studying occultism for about 6 years in the Vatican City."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"It's a big shock coming back to a town of this size."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Feeling like slitting my wrists right about now. I'm not exactly\na fan of the Prehevilian melancholy."
"I thought Prehevil was a medium-sized city."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Even medium-sized cities can be uncivilized, believe me."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Probably not. I'll be heading towards the town soon if nothing\nhappens here."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Oh yeah... It was cool."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"There is something bothering me though... No one talked much\nabout the moon. That rapist-smile will leave a scar in my \nsub-consciousness for sure."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Maybe it's just because I've been studying this stuff for the\nmajority of my life, but I think it was a vision, meant for us \nto decipher."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Just seems obvious, you know."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"That's why I have hard time believing the conspiracy stuff the\nother guys were talking about."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Just felt a little artistic..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Actually I hate drawing. I'm really bad at it."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Luckily ritual circles don't require the same skills."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Honestly I just had an ominous feeling about all this.\. Maybe\nthis little carving will have some use..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Here, you can loan this. Once the circle is done, you might find\nsome use for it too."
You get \c[2]Skin bible - God of Fear and Hunger\c[0]!
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Just give me the book back later, okay?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"H-hey what do you think you're doing!?"
You absorbed the \c[2]Changeling soul\c[0].
You read her mind...\n\c[1]"I'm just postponing this, who am I fooling?"\c[0]
You read her mind...\n\c[1]"Marina, get a grip!"\c[0]
You read her mind...\n\c[1]"It can't be that bad..."\c[0]
Something in the suitcase caught your eye... You didn't notice\nbefore that there's something underneath the socks and \nunderwear...
You find a \c[2]Bolt cutters\c[0]!
A basket full of potatos. They are no use without cooking them\nfirst.

"No one came for the train yet?"
\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"If you came to have some, you missed the dinner by few hours."
\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"Come back tomorrow morning. I'll continue from where I left of."
\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"Obviously not. There's something very odd about this situation."

\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"How about you? When did you last have a rest?"
"How's the train looking?"

\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Usually if I have a problem in front of me, I act, and fix the\ndamn thing, but..."

\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"I was thinking about heading to the city in a bit."

"Where are you headed."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"I'm going to investigate those tunnels a little bit more..."

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"We can finally call his bluff. I'm growing tired of the lanky man\nat the top of the tower."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Bah, it's nothing. Hallucination can only affect you if you let\nthem."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Yep... It's bullshit."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"We're on the same wavelength in that one."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I'm leaning towards the army experiment theory..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"The locals seem to be suffering from symptoms that resemble \nradiation burns and mutations..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Then we are seeing vivid dreams every night and the city has\nthis ethereal feel to it... That makes me think of hallucinogens."
"What could be causing the radiation?"
"Hallucinogens?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"It's not exactly public knowledge, but a year ago I was investigating\na scoop that involved the Allied countries..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"The Kingdom of Rondon and Valland had their highest army officials \ngathered on a remote island hundreds of kilometers from the coastline\nin the Bleu Sea."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"They had a new kind of experimental weapon ready for war. It was \n'a plutonium-based implosion-type device'."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"A ridiculously big bomb in other words. One that created a crater\nover 300 metres wide."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Obviously the thing totally demolished the island it was used on,\nbut what made the bomb even more terrifying and vile was that the\nplutonium used in the bomb left the area radiated."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"The wildlife near the island suffered greatly from the nuclear \nradiation. Many of the animals had similar-ish symptoms you see here\nin people."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Radiation poisoning and burns, the most drastic effects were \nmutations. Sounds familiar, right?"
"You think a similar bomb was detonated here?"
"Science can't explain the things happening here."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"No, no, not at all. This place would be far more wrecked if that\nwas the case."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I'm just thinking that Bremen and Eastern Union must be aware of \nthe weapon the Allied countries have at their disposal."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Whatever is happening here, could be an alternative to that."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Somekind of a new weapon Bremen snuck from the Eastern Union \nwhen they occupied this area."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Why else see all the effort getting to this small town in the\nmiddle of nowhere?"
"Why wasn't the Allied weapon ever used in war?"
"Any theories what it could be?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"You don't need to shoot your gun when robbing a bank. It's enough \nif you just point the thing."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"You must have noticed that neither Bremen nor Eastern Union tried\nto expand their borders towards west for a good while now."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I don't have all the puzzle pieces yet... There is something more\nto this. Something that causes all the dreams and drives people to \nmadness..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Oh you're one of those people..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Sure, go ahead and believe in your old gods. I just don't think\nwe have enough common ground to continue this discussion."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"That's still something that I can't quite put my head around."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Every one of us has seen hallucinations and lucid dreams. From the\nlooks of things, the locals also suffered from similar problems..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I don't know yet. I need to investigate more."

\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Not only western, but in my home country they teach the same as\nwell. So I cannot blame you."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"That is where the yellow mages differ. We bend the powers of \nthe older gods to serve our personal gain."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Magick, otherwordly, older gods - they are all just stepping stones\non our path to enlightenment. To greater knowledge."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Fancy words for personal growth."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"That is an interesting approach."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"I'm happy to hear some among the younger generations are able\nto think outside the box."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"I'm not recruiting anyone to join and become a yellow mage, but\nif you survive this ordeal - it might be worth your while to read\nup on the philosophy of the yellow mages."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"It is close to that of yours."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Like everyone dedicating their life to the otherwordly should."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"I'm glad to hear you're not entirely mislead in the greater scheme\nof things."

\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Nothing kills a momentum like idleness."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"You have not?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Ah, I suppose that makes sense."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Our kind has become rarer and rarer by each passing year."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"That's one way to put it..."
"How does magic work?"
"Can't your gods help us?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"That's quite a broad topic..."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"...\. It all comes down to your willpower. Our minds are far \nstronger than what you'd guess just by looking at your average \npeasant."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"There is a greater scheme that we all enact, 'fate' if you will.\nYou can manipulate that force and bend it to your own will."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"You need blind, unconditional belief in yourself to achieve this."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"People rarely possess such traits though. Even the most megalomaniac\ndictators in the world have a seed of doubt at the back of their \nhead, gnawing at their self-confidence."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"That was actually a bad example. Such dictators usually are the\nleast capable of magick thanks to their fragile ego."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"But in any case, because of the human weakness, a conduit is\noften necessary. If we cannot believe in ourselves, maybe we can\nbelieve in higher powers."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Through worship of the older gods we can channel our unconditional\nbelief and thus create simple tricks that manipulate the world around\nus."
"So gods don't really gift us with magic?"
"Sounds simple."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"I never said that."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Whose to say gods aren't manifestations of our unconditional belief\nas well?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Maybe they are just extensions of our mind. So in a sense the\ngift of magick would come from them?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"This is a hotly debated topic among grand priests."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"These are just theories of course. So use this information with\na grain of salt."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"We are just miserable humans after all. What do we know?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Mind you, it's not quite this simple in practise. Human mind is\nwavering even when you think you have it under control."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"But that's the gist of it."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Help us? They're the ones that caused all this."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"We have to take some responsibility ourselves. It's up to us\nto survive."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Gods couldn't care less what ants do on the ground level."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Sure. Let us go."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Your party seems very much complete as it is. I don't think my\naid is really necessary."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Maybe some other time?"

\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"The moon? I don't get it."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"... Oh, that moon."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"The moon made you do it, huh?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Is that a threat?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"You do know which one of us is tied up here?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"You're not in a position to make threats."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"A stone cold murderer... Is that what you want to be?"

\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"You mean the moon from the nightmare?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Let me get this straight - In a dream someone, not even 'someone',\nbut a frickin' moon god told you to kill, and that's why you did\nwhat you did?"
"That is how the festival works!"

\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"I'm not good at this kind of stuff..."

"Wait up!"
"You have to help me!"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Hi... How are you doing?"
"I'm fine."
"Cut me free or I'll kill you!"
"I'm starving!"
"I'm so sorry..."

\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"You don't want to talk. I understand."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"We thought you could use some food. Since we are still out here,\nstranded in the middle of the woods..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"It might still take a while before we get out."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"So how about it? This is all we got at the moment."
She is offering you a loaf of bread.
"Thank you."
"I don't need your pity."
Just eat it
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"You're welcome."

\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Oh... Well..."

\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"Or is it...? I don't really know how to feel about this situation."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"Ah... Yes... You've been here for a while."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"Regret itself is not good, but if it's used to reflect oneself, \nthen it can lead to growth."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"And that's good. It's the first step towards redemption."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"I'm not in a mood for a talk either."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"We thought we need to keep you alive until the police come.\nSo you will need some food, right?"
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"It might still take a while before we get out. So this is all\nwe got for now."
He is offering you a loaf of bread.
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"But you do need food. Are you sure you don't want this?"

\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Cold blood..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Maybe I was mistaken? Maybe you're not that hungry?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Good. If it was up to me, you'd be starving even longer."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"But alas, the others are more compassionate than me."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Save your tears for the cops."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"I just came to give you something to eat. Because it's the human\nthing to do. Something you should learn more about."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Nothing?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Good. I didn't want to hear your rubbish anyway."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"In any case, it's your lucky day. I got this moldy bread loaf \nfor you."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Yep, what you need is a good whoopin', but I'll leave that to\nthe Bohemian law enforcers."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"But since you're not hungry..."
Marcoh eats the bread loaf in front of you. He seems to be savouring\nthe bread for as long as possible.
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"A bit dry, but serves its purpose."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Well I'm off. Have a good day."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Hi..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"You probably noticed that we are still stuck here."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"The thing is... There is something weird going on in this place..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"It's hard to describe. The local people... Something has happened\nto them. They've gone crazy."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"I... I don't really know what to do. Most of the people went for\nthe city, but they never returned."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"I fear something bad has happened to them..."
"What do you mean that there is something wrong with the locals?"
"How many are there still left at the train?"
"I fail to see how any of this is my problem?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"You'd have to see it to believe. They've changed. They look...\nThey look sick... And malformed..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"It's unlike anything I've ever seen. Even the worst gothic novels\npale in comparison."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Ah... That's... It's better if I don't tell you too much."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"That's what I was told anyway. I hope you understand."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Uh... Well when you put it that way..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"The reason why I'm telling you all this..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"I think I need to leave the train too. We just can't stay here\nany longer."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"But I'll send help here the moment we meet someone."
"You can't just leave me behind!"
"You open these ropes now or I'll kill you!"
"B-but how can I survive here on my own?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"We discussed about this..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"I don't like it, but... You are an liability."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"But don't worry! We'll send someone here later!"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"I promise!"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"I don't like it, but... You are a liability."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"I'm sorry about this..."

\>\i[81]\}AMARIE\{\<\n"I... I was kept at the ninth circle at the Ministry of Darkness."
Just hearing the words 'ninth circle' sends a shiver down your\nspine. You've heard rumours of the place.
The Vatican City has desperately been trying to reach the older \ngods for hundereds of years, all without luck.
Supposedly a select group of children who were considered naturally \ngifted at channeling the otherworldly were locked at the ninth circle\nwhere their bodies would wither in an ancient rite to receive any\nmessages from the older gods. All without luck.
\>\i[81]\}AMARIE\{\<\n"So... I didn't study with you. It wasn't like that."
"Ninth circle is real?"

"No, I got a plan."

Pav is down...
You get an \c[2]Army uniform\c[0], a \c[2]Lugr pistol\c[0] and 10 \c[2]9mm Bullets\c[0].
You took \c[2]Pav's head\c[0] as a trophy!

The well seems dark and deep. You get an urge to jump down...
Jump down
As your eyes adjust to the darkness, the well doesn't look that deep\nafter all...
You can see the bottom of pretty easily. The well has dried up.
There is a well here...

Black Kalev is eating...
Give him a \c[2]Carrot\c[0]
"I guess we all could use a small break."
"We need to get going now."
"Enough with the munching!"
Black Kalev takes the carrot nonchalantly and returns to\nyour party.
\>\i[65]\}LACK KALEV\{\<\n"..."
Black Kalev gives you absolutely no attention at all.
Black Kalev disagrees with you.
In a spur of rebellion Black Kalev started munching on the\ngrass with even more vigor.
It seems to mock you.
Seems like Black Kalev was waiting for you already...
"Are you ready to continue?"
"Just wait here a little while longer."
Black Kalev joins back your party.
You search through the leaves...
Something tells you that there might be something hidden here...
You find a \c[2]Smelter key\c[0]!
The lone goat came to greet you. The goat seems to be following\nyour every move attentively.
"Want to join my party?"
"I can't take you as a burden."
The goat is shaking its horns in agreement.
The goat is shaking its horns in disagreement.
It's not willing to take no for an answer it seems.
The goat joins your party.
The body is badly mutilated...
The body has nothing of value.
\>\i[85]\}OODSMAN\{\<\n"TERMINA IS UPON US!"
Suddenly Black Kalev stops on its hooves...
GabText You hear something from ahead...
There's a lone goat here. It seems to be minding its own\nbusiness, completely ignoring your presence.
Give it a \c[2]Carrot\c[0]!
Pet it
The goat eats the carrot without any festivities.
It still doesn't acknowledge your existence in the slightest.
You pet its head. Absolutely no reaction. Its glassy eyes\nstare right through you.
It almost feels like the goat thinks so highly of itself that\nit doesn't need to acknowledge you.
The goat stares to the distance with its glassy eyes. On the\nfirst glance the creature seems harmless, but upon further\ninvestigating it, you are met with feelings of great dread.
You can't really explain why this is...
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"This one is creepy. Really weird."
The lone goat greets you. The goat seems to be following\nyour every move attentively.
Unfortunately you do not have rooms for one more goat in your\nparty.
You pick up a \c[2]Fly amanita\c[0].
A badly mutilated head of a villager...
\>\i[85]\}OODSMAN\{\<\n"Leave now stranger."
\>\i[85]\}OODSMAN\{\<\n"LEAVE."

"Did you kill that man?"
"You were the one who helped me?"

\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Let's see what we can find here..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Green herbs often grow in open areas. These cliffs and rocky hills\nshould be optimal for them."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"If we look behind every nook and cranny, we should find more of\nthem..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Let's check this house out. There has to be someone sane left in\nthis godforsaken little town..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Everyone's gone crazy here, haven't they?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"No matter how many houses we check. No one with a right mind around."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"The old town is just north of here... Let's head towards the city\ncenter."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Should go knocking on the door? There could be someone who could\nhelp us?"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"The house looks charming enough..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"The silence of these woods... Does it soothe and calm you?"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Because it surely doesn't do that to me! It's creepy!"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"What are the chances that there would be someone nice and normal \nwaiting for us inside?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Yeah, we'd be better off playing lottery."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Maybe we could take a small break inside?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"I should've packed my hiking boots with me... I'm getting blisters\nfrom all this walking."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"The house could work as a decent vantage point..."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"I can smell the old town from here. What a foul smell that place\nhas."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"I wouldn't mind growing old in a house like this..."

\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Erm, nevermind."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"We got more pressing matters."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Is it normal to have this much fog around these parts?"
Only a \c[2]Fly amanita\c[0] here.
A bloody ritual crucifix. They used to have these in the olden\ntimes, but you've never seen one in person.
The smell and sight of the sacrificed corpses is repulsive!\nYou feel like throwing up.
GabText You hear distant screams and ramblings... You are not alone.
GabText The trenchgun destroys the lock!
GabText The death mask is shot down!
GabText You shoot the arm of the death mask!

The doorway is boarded up from outside. Is it to keep something\nin?
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"The tall monster of a man seems to have rash all over its body.\nThe rash seems to focus on the neck area and possibly to face\nand head, but that is impossible to tell because of the mask."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"The mask itself has melted on the patient's face and formed\na light layer of exoskeleton-like crust that continues from\nthe mask to the neck."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Despite somewhat large frame, the man seems to be weak against\npiercing attacks as well as otherwordly powers."

The gate is locked firmly with two different padlocks...
You seem to have both of the required keys. Remove the chains?
The other padlock has a carving of an eagle and the other has\na carving of a two-tailed lion.
Force the gate open
Remove chains?
You can only see dusty interior inside. It doesn't seem like\na place that has seen much life and excitement recently...
No reaction. He must be dead. But for how long?
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"I'm confused. I can still feel a pulse from this thing."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"All the wounds and beating this guy took would suggest that he's\ngood as dead, but no..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"I don't know. Don't ask me these hard questions."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Even I don't have all the answers."
The person seems to still be alive. At least you can still feel\nhis pulse.
This goes against everything you know and understand. The wounds\non his body should be lethal but something is keeping him alive.
You do not have answers for this.
You took the \c[2]Death mask head\c[0] as a trophy!
It looks like someone is standing still in the darkness...
You pick up a \c[2]Red herb\c[0].

Skip The Character History?
The soothing sound of the railtracks... You are not used to such\npeaceful and tranquil atmosphere.
You can't help but let your mind wander. You reminisce what has\nlead you to this point in life...
Prehevil. It's your hometown, even if it has a tainted past\npainted all around its narrow alleyways.
The painful memories would start from that one night...
Your parents were arguing downstairs. The argument would heat up, \nlike always, and it would turn into a fight.
Your mother charged inside your room in desperation. She locked\nthe door and pushed it with all her might.
First the odor of old vodka carried over to your room, then you\nheard your father's heavy steps walk up the stairs.
Your father started bashing down the door.
Pray for a god
Stand up against your father
Which god?
Gro-goroth
Sylvian
Alll-mer
The moon god
Vinushna
The god of fear & hunger
The gods didn't answer to your prayers this time, but you made\na pact with the said god for life.
Your efforts didn't matter much before the drunken stupor of\nyour father. It did raise your maximum bodily resilience though.
With your mother gone and your father drinking in the gutter, you\nwere taken to the Prehevil orphanage.
The place treated children awfully and all kinds of rumours\ncirculated on why kids would disappear occasionally without a trace.
You couldn't wait to get out of there as soon as possible. Unfortunately \nyour wishes were answered sooner than you could've guessed.
When the second great war started, the Eastern Union recruited \nevery able-bodied person no matter the age to fight for the\nmotherland.
You were only 13 at the time, but still they dragged you with\nthem. What kind of weaponry did you specialize in?
Pistols
Rifles
Trenchguns
You got \c[2]Lugr Pistol\c[0] and 10 \c[2]9mm Bullets\c[0]!
You got \c[2]Rifle .303 Mk I\c[0] and 4 \c[2].303 Ammo\c[0]!
You got \c[2]12-gauge Trenchgun\c[0] and 3 \c[2]12-gauge shells\c[0]!
You excelled on the battlefield despite your age. However you\ngrew bitter as you saw younger and younger kids being recruited\nand killed as the war dragged on.
By this time you were already responsible for your own squad of\nchild soldiers. You were given a mission meant for expendables, \none that would be a guaranteed suicide mission.
You were already growing tired of the haphazard way of distributing \ntroops and the general morale of the Eastern Union army was starting \nto show its cracks...
Take the mission and fulfil your duty
Abandon the sinking ship
You survived the mission despite impossible odds. This increased \nyour proficiency in your branch of weaponry.
You learn \c[2]Gunslinger\c[0]!
You learn \c[2]Marksmanship\c[0]!
You learn \c[2]Executioner\c[0]!
Unfortunately the mission had its toll on you as well. Your psyche \ncouldn't handle all the losses on the battlefield. So you had to \ntake opioids to ease the pain. You formed an addiction.
You got \c[2]Heroin\c[0] and withdrawal symptoms!
You couldn't stand up for this any longer and became a deserter.\nThe Eastern Union wouldn't forgive such crimes, so you had to pack \nup wisely for your escape...
Stock up on medical goods
Stock up on ammo
Stock up on food
You managed to find 2 \c[2]Blue vials\c[0] and a \c[2]Cloth fragment\c[0]!
You managed to find 3 \c[2].303 Ammo\c[0]!
You managed to find 2 \c[2]12-gauge shells\c[0]!
You managed to find 4 \c[2]9mm Bullets\c[0]!
You managed to find 2 \c[2]Dried meats\c[0] and a \c[2]Moldy bread\c[0]!
How long has it been? Feels like a lifetime since you left the \ntown...
It's not a place anyone would want to return to, but when you got no\nother place in this world, you are left with no options...
Save your character history?
Skip the intro?
You feel like someone was watching you while you slept...
You were born into the church of Alll-mer. For many generations \nyour lineage took part in the most wicked of rituals only to \nappease gods of a forgotten age.
A life of a dark priest is a cruel one even if modern times \noverlooked the most archaic and ancient rites. A dark priest's life \nbegins and ends in full dedication to the older gods. There is\nno place for self in the church.
You mother had different plans for you. She didn't want you to\ngo down the path that would befall to every firstborn son in church.
So when she finally let your father know of your birth, she told \nhim a daughter was born to the household.
You were dressed accordingly. Your distant and often absent father \ndidn't get a wind of the original nature of things, or he just\ndenied what was in front of his face. In either case, the subject \nwas never brought up.
As you grew a little bit older, you didn't question this either.\nEverything felt natural this way, so who cares?
You grew up at the churchyard in the city of Prehevil. You started\nyour religious studies at a fairly young age.
You were given an option to choose which studies you would pursue - \nSomething completely unheard of if you had been a firstborn son of\na dark priest.
Study occultism
Study alchemy
Study blood magic
You learn \c[2]Engrave\c[0]!
You got the books \c[2]Alchemillia vol. 1 and vol. 2\c[0]!
You learn \c[2]Necromancy\c[0]!
You proved out to have great talent as an occultist and slowly\neven the holy city of Vatican and their Ministry of Darkness heard\nabout your feats.
You were offered a scholarship at the Vatican City to further\neducate yourself. You took the position without hesitation.
Just the idea of getting away from your condescending and stuck\nup father was enough to make the decision, not to mention the \nobvious benefits the Vatican City would have to offer. Your home\ntown wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis.
Your mother was very proud of you. She always was. Your father \non the other hand seemed jealous of you.
Your father had always been antagonistic towards you and your\npursuits. You were not sure if it had something to do with your\norigin or if there was something else left unsaid...
At the Ministry of Darkness, Vatican City - In the initiation\nceremony all the new student would have to choose an older god \nthat they'd let inside them.
Who did you choose?
Vinushka
You affliction with the said god grew greatly.
Everything was going well with your studies until one day you\ngot a letter from home. It was written by your father. This was \nvery strange. You didn't have any contact with him since your \ndeparture.
The letter told that your mother had passed away. The words were\ncold and without sympathy.
You tried calling your home but the telephone exchange couldn't \nconnect to any phone in the Prehevilian area.
You had a suspicion that your father had something to do with \nthis. He had always been too obsessed with the blood magic and \nyou had learned that there were too many rites that demanded the \nblood of your loved ones to work.
There was no other way. You had to prepare for a trip back home, \nto Prehevil.
How did you prepare for the travels?
Get something to read
You get \c[2]Skin bible - Gro-goroth\c[0]!
You get \c[2]Skin bible - Rher\c[0]!
You get \c[2]Skin bible - Vinushka\c[0]!
Since you were a toddler, you had been travelling around the\nEuropa with your parents.
Your parents were devout followers of the older god of fertility\nand creation, Sylvian.
Because of the nature of Sylvian's cult, in each new town you'd \nwitness your parents putting on their rabbit masks and heading to \nthe meadows naked with all the other cult members.
You hated this life. Your parents would be more concerned on the \nmatters of religion than you. To make it worse, they even tried \nto pass on the healing gift of Sylvian to you.
From very early on you learned that no gift comes without a price. \nWith Sylvian's "gift of healing" you saw how the mental state of \nyour parents deteriorated over time.
They spent longer and longer times on the meadows. Until one day \nthey never returned...
You were 13 years of age and alone in the Kingdom of Rondon. You \nhad to do something for living...
Try to find honest work
Try to become a pickpocket
A butler of a local aristocrat took you under his wing as an \napprentice. You started working for the Baron Eihner Von Dutch.
You learned good manners, grew to appreciate fine arts and other \nperks that high class living brought along.
Over time you got better acquainted with the daughter of the \nhouse. Her name was Elise. She would be endlessly amused by your \nchildhood stories and all the madness your past cult life brought\nwith it. 
The baron himself learned of you upbringing as well and was \nfascinated by Sylvian and her healing properties.
The baron used to work as a doctor and he had very different concepts \nfor healing and mending wounds.
He taught you about the modern medical practices in exchange for\nyour knowledge on the older god Sylvian. To be honest, his thirst \nfor otherwordly knowledge felt a little bit obsessive even.
He taught you how you cannot cure any symptoms without giving\nsomething in return. To heal, something of equal value must be \nlost.
Memorize this very line
Continue with the studies to learn more
You learned \c[2]Medicinal\c[0] and the mandatory skill of \c[2]Organ\nHarvest\c[0] that comes along with it.
You learned \c[2]Analyze\c[0]!
The most important thing learned is that you trade your life,\nyour self in the practice of medicine. That is the price to save\nlives of the others.
You didn't have any natural talent as a pickpocket per se and\nthe underworld of Rondon was very rough on you...
You weren't cut out to be a street thug, so you had to rely on the \nonly skills you had for the money... The healing gift of Sylvian.
You ended up starting a street praction of medical care where \nyou'd heal people of all social classes.
You soon became surprisingly adept with the healing gift of\nSylvian.
You learned \c[2]Loving whispers\c[0] and your affinity with\nSylvian grew!
One day the local doctor and aristocrat, Baron Eihner Von Dutch \ncame to your dirty office out of curiosity.
He wasn't familiar with the Sylvian's teachings. The modern medical\ncare worked with very different concepts and methods where magic \ncertainly wasn't included in the curriculum.
Nevertheless, the baron was fascinated by your otherwordly means \nof healing and was impressed by the results.
He made a proposition to you that you simply couldn't turn down.\nHe offered to take you in as his apprentice and in return he only \nasked to learn more about Sylvian and other older gods.
You agreed and moved in to his huge manor. The first one to welcome \nyou was the daughter of the baron, Elise Von Dutch. Something \ninside you changed that very moment as the two of you locked eyes.
As time went on, you became an item with Elise. Everything fell \ninto place very naturally and even the baron gave you his blessing \ndespite your background being anything but noble.
For the first time in your life, everything felt just right. But \nthis wouldn't last for long as something terrible had been brewing \nin the Eastern Europa for a good while.
The conflict between the Eastern Union and the Bremen Empire had\ndragged many neighbouring countries to take part in the hostilities \nand the Kingdom of Rondon was no exception.
The kingdom was enlisting all able-bodied men to the frontlines \nand you had no choice but to pack your bags and join the Great War.
Because of your knowledge in medicine, you were given an option \nto join the army as a medic or pick up a gun and join as an \ninfantry trooper.
Join as a medic
Join the infantry
You were given a \c[2]Scalpel\c[0], a \c[2]Light blue vial\c[0]\nand \c[2]Pep pills\c[0]!
You were given a \c[2]Lugr Pistol\c[0] and 5 \c[2]9mm Bullets\c[0]
The war was cruel and inhumane. You had to take part in countless \nthings better left unspoken.
The only thing that kept you going was the thought of your new \nfamily waiting for you back home. Every night you'd read letters \nfrom home and fall asleep to a photograph of Elise.
One day the letters ended. It was natural for letters to get \nlost in all the chaos, but you couldn't help your ominous feelings...
So when the Kingdom of Rondon finally withdrew from the war, you \nrushed straight back home as fast as possible...
The manor of Von Dutch was lifeless and dark on that gloomy day. \nYou stormed through the countless rooms, but couldn't find a soul \nin sight.
That was until you found the basement door partly open. In the\ndarkness below you could only tell apart the silhouette of a person \nwho had died standing in the middle of swirling ritual circles.
The person was Eihner Von Dutch himself. He had died on the spot\nfrom what seemed like self-inflicted wounds and cuts.
Each corner of the basement had sacrificial gifts to an old god\nunknown to you. Your heart sank as you recognized just who was\nthe main sacrifice of this maddening rite.
You tried to save Elise with any means necessary. You tried to\nexchange vital parts of yourself for the life of her, but that\ndidn't work. You tried unspeakable methods for days, but it was\nall in vain. She was too far gone.
Occult had completely swallowed the baron while you were away and\nyou could only guess what he had tried to accomplish with this \nunholy ritual.
Upon searching through baron's documents you noticed a certain place\nmentioned frequently time and time again. A town called  Prehevil in\nthe country of Bohemia.
The place had something to do with the beliefs of the baron and\nmaybe there you'd find at least some sense to this madness.
It wouldn't bring back your old life, but frankly, you had nothing\nelse going for you anymore. Only this small clue on what took \neverything away from you.
Answers... That was enough of a reason to get you back on the \nroad.
How did you prepare for your trip?
Stock up on alcohol
You managed to find a bottle of \c[2]Beer\c[0] and a bottle of \n\c[2]Vodka\c[0]!
It's been a long and mentally taxing travel to this point...
You hope that whatever you find from this small town could give \nat least some closure to your sorrow...
Despite your homeland suffering greatly from the First Great War, \nyou had a peaceful and balanced childhood with both of your \nparents and many siblings.
The northern capital Oldegård was rebuilding their destroyed\ncities, when news about hostilities in the eastern Europa were\nbroadcasted on the radio.
It sounded like the beginning of another worldwide war...
You were still too young to take part in defending your borders \nso you had to figure out an alternate way to help out your homefront.
You had a knack for mechanics and electronics, so ultimately it \ncame down to those two lines of studies...
Learn electronics
Learn mechanics
You learned \c[2]Short circuit\c[0]!
You learned \c[2]Wrench toss\c[0]!
Because you were the eldest child, you had a natural habit of \ntaking care of those around you.
Many of your close relatives marched to battle and nothing could've \ngotten you more frustrated than your inability to help people more\ndirectly.
You had already matured to adulthood, but because of your expertise \nin engineering, your role on the homefront was more important than \nwhat you could've achieved on the battlefield.
The homefront was in disorder too. Someone had to step up and \ncover the all the missing men now dying far away on some remote \nbattlefields.
Your broad shoulders could carry the burden and the increasing work\nload. They had to, because if not you, then who?
During one particularly stormy night, while you were returning\nhome after your twelve hour day, you ran into a foreign man on \na rain soaked alleyway...
The man noticed you and desperately tried to run for it only to \ncollapse after weakly ten meters or so.
The man had been shot to the belly. Upon searching his possessions, \nyou found his documents that said he was from the Kingdom of \nRondon, an allied country of Oldegård's.
You thought about what to do for a moment and then...
Reported the man to officials.
Took the man back home and treated his wounds.
You reported the man to the officials of Oldegård. Apparently he \nhad just recently travelled from the Eastern Union to Oldegård \nand was suspected for espionage.
There was even a bounty on his head. You got 10 \c[2]Shillings\c[0] for\nfinding him. One of the shillings ended up being a \c[2]Lucky coin\c[0]!\nLucky you!
Something bothered you about the case and you returned to the \nalley where you first found the man. Upon thoroughly searching the \nalleyway, you found a suitcase full of top secret documents stolen \nfrom the Eastern Union.
On his memo, the man had written down an address that pointed to \nthe Kingdom of Rondon.
The documents didn't look like those of an Eastern Union spy.\nThey looked the exact opposite in fact. You decided to take the\npapers to Rondon by yourself.
The man stayed unconscious for a week, but slowly recovered thanks \nto your attentive mending.
As days went by, he saw your eagerness to help and frustation\ntowards the war. He then revealed his business in Oldegård.
He was part of an underground resistance organization called "Nameless \nLiberty Underground", NLU in short.
The organization had been brewing hidden from watching eyes \nsince the dawn of the first Great War. NLU worked across Europa \ntrying to subdue the advancement of both Bremen Empire and Eastern \nUnion.
The man had important documents that needed to be taken to\nKingdom of Rondon as soon as possible. Because he couldn't\nobviously take them there himself, he asked if you could take \nhis role.
You had been hoping for a chance to work on something bigger and \nthis opportunity seemed to be just that.
You packed your bags and set out.
As a thanks for his rescue, the man gave you his \c[2]Officer sword\c[0].
You travelled through Europa all the way to Kingdom of Rondon. \nYou found the meeting point described by the man and made contact \nwith his colleagues.
It turned out that the man was part of an underground resistance \norganization called "Nameless Liberty Underground", NLU in short.
The organization had been brewing hidden from watching eyes \nsince the dawn of the first Great War. NLU worked across Europa \ntrying to subdue the advancement of both Bremen Empire and \nEastern Union.
After talking briefly about the current situation in the eastern\nEuropa, you were asked to join the organization. They were running \nlow on members and your expertise would surely come handy.
You were lead to their headquarters and you got to choose how \nyou'd offer your help...
Help with creating weapons.
Help with creating traps.
You learned \c[2]Weaponcraft\c[0]!
You learned \c[2]Trapcraft\c[0]!
NLU had spies everywhere in Europa and beyond. Combining various\ninformation snippets gathered from across the continent you were \nable to unravel parts of a larger scheme...
The Eastern Union had been working on something malevolent and \nill-boding in the country of Bohemia and it seemed like Bremen \nwanted to get their hand on this project.
Your deductions got a lot more weight when you heard that Bremen \narmy finally occupied Bohemia. NLU sent some of their members \nimmediately to the capital of Bohemia, Prehevil, but you quickly \nlost contact to them.
The organization decided to wait and see if their members would \nsurface, but you couldn't just sit back and hope for the best.
You decided to take the first train towards Prehevil and find out \nwhat was going on.
You were told that if you needed support in your mission you'd \nrecognize the leader of the Bohemian branch of NLU from her red \nshoes.
With this little information about the task at hand, how did \nyou prepare for the trip?
Stock up on spare parts
You managed to find 4 \c[2]Bolts\c[0], 2 \c[2]Duct tape\c[0],\n2 \c[2]Pressure plates\c[0] and 3 \c[2]Scrap metal\c[0]!
You've felt tense since the moment you embarked on this journey. \nEvery night you'd see nightmares of the horrors that would wait \nyou in Prehevil...
Are they just dreams? You can't help but feel that there is more to\nthe dreams than mere logic would dictate.
Your working overalls...? Did you forget to change your clothes?
You could've sworn you were wearing something different...
For the majority of your life you've only known the streets of \nthe Vatican City. This is actually the first time in your life \nyou're travelling this far from those narrow and crowded alleyways.
Things don't look that fancy elsewhere. Travelling is overrated you\nthink to yourself.
In your earliest memories you remember spending time with your \nparents, but then suddenly you just didn't have parents anymore.
You can't remember what happened, but from one point onwards it\nwas just you and your sister against the world.
You were still only ten years old but you had to make a living \nsomehow...
Become a pickpocket
Become a burglar
Try to lead a honest life
You learned \c[2]Steal\c[0]!
The Vatican City was full of streets kids similar to you and in \nno time you learned the tricks of the trade. You tried your hand \nin pickpocketing.
It worked for some time, but too often you got caught in the act \nwhich resulted in you getting beaten up.
You learned \c[2]Lockpicking\c[0]!
The Vatican City was full of streets kids similar to you and in \nno time you learned the tricks of the trade. You tried your hand \nin breaking into apartments and stealing all the valuables you \ncould carry.
You tried different odd jobs. The only thing common with all of \nthem was that eventually you messed things up and got fired.
Still you were able to save up 10 \c[2]Shillings\c[0]!
The streets schooled you hard, but as you grew older you noticed that\nyou started to tower over those who bullied you before. If someone\nstill tried to do you dirty, you were quickly able to give them a taste\nof your justice.
Because of your size and skills in fighting, you started to attract\nattention of local street gangs that tried to recruit you as their\nmuscle. This never sounded right to you.
You had been extorted of your measly salaries too many times. \nYou didn't want to do the same to anyone.
But turning down small-time criminals only got you to further \ntrouble. Almost every other night you'd end up in street fights.
At one point you realized that you were doing more fighting than \nactual work, not to mention that's where you got most of your money \ntoo.
You started to consider fighting as your job. Maybe it would be\nworth investing into it more? You started to work out more \nregularly and follow a strict regimen.
Train strength
Bulk up in mass
Improve your footwork
Train your stamina
You tried to train your explosive power so your strikes would pack\nmore punch.
You started doing more push-ups, you used animal carcasses as \npunching bags at the local butcher where you worked part-time, you \nclimbed fire escape ladders instead of using stairs and so on...
You managed to increase your strength with a couple of levels in\nthe end.
You thought that bulking up could make you more resistant to punches.\nSo you started eating like a bear, at least tripling your calorie \nintake.
That combined with lifting weights (the sofa at your apartment), \ndragging horse carriages with your body along with other resistance \nexercises proved to have obvious effects.
You managed to increase your defence with a couple of levels in\nthe end.
You thought that swift feet would prove useful in boxing ring. \nIt wouldn't matter how hard one would punch, if that punch never \nconnects.
You spiced up your boxing drills by tying sand bags to your arms \nand feet. Every time you started to get used to the weights, you'd \ndouble the bags.
You didn't really feel the change until you finally dropped the\nweights and noticed how light and lighting fast your movements were\nwithout the additional baggage. Your agility leveled up at least\ntwice during all that.
You started your days by running the Tiberian river upstream.\n'The ten thousand steps of penitence' located at the heart of the \ncity also became familiar to you. Day and night you'd be running \nthose stairs up and down.
In the end your stamina did increase and in following fights you could\neasily take one or two more hits than before.
You were doing alright in fights, so much so that you started to\nbuild a little reputation on the streets.
In no time you moved on to underground boxing rings where there \nwas more money on the table and less danger of the opponent \npulling a knife in the middle of a match.
While you were busy in the ring, your sister had grown into a \nbeautiful young woman who attracted all kinds of admirers. It \nwould have meant trouble if it wasn't for your mean reputation.
Most low life thugs on the streets knew that they'd have to answer \nto you if they tried anything dodgy.
That didn't mean that there weren't those who tried. She started \nto get close with a known mobster Riccardo Accardo.
He was the heir to the Accardo branch of The Family. The Family \nwas an organized body of criminals operating in the Vatican City.
In all intents and purposes The Family was a mafia, but they\nalso had deep ties to the church which in turn was running the\ncountry. So it was a bit more complicated...
Despite being a mobster, Riccardo seemed decent enough. He had a \nflirtatious and flattering way of speaking and in general got\nalong with everyone. He took notice in your skills and tried to\ncasually recruit you to their ranks.
You politely declined the offer.
Since you didn't take the offer, Riccardo had another one on the\nplatter - He proposed that he'd hook you up with a real boxing \ntrainer to get you to the next level.
You again declined, but your sister insisted that you'd at least \ntry it out. You agreed.
Things started to feel more professional the second you stepped\ninside the gym. The trainer, an elderly gentleman who had an impressive \nrecord of previous apprentices, was impressed by your raw skills.
He thought that the best way to push you further would be to choose \nwhere to specialize.
Specialize in accuracy
Specialize in evasion
Specialize in defence
Specialize in offence
You learned \c[2]Bare-fisted proficiency\c[0]!
You learned \c[2]Bob and weave\c[0]!
You learned \c[2]Perfect guard\c[0]!
You learned \c[2]Adrenaline rush\c[0]!
His methods proved effective. Soon you had your first real bout\nin the ring and won the match with relative ease. Your sister \nand Riccardo were there to congratulate you.
You continued with your winning streak. The hype around you was \ngrowing, slowly even you started to believe the hype.
Riccardo was able to organize big matches one after another. You \nstarted spending more time inside The Family quarters with Riccardo \nand your sister.
Without noticing it you had been pulled into the criminal world.\nWhat started as helping out a friend, became a more frequent \noccurrence.
Soon Riccardo showed his true colours as well. He had been building\nyou up for a fated boxing match. Apparently your next opponent was\na former family member who had cut all ties to the organization.\nYour job was to kill him in a boxing match.
You politely declined. But at this point there was no turning back.\nRiccardo reminded that he got your sister back at his flat and she'd\nfeel it in her skin if you didn't comply.
You didn't know what to do. Soon you found yourself in the ring\nwith the ex-family member and the bell rang. He was a tough\nopponent but you managed to get the best of him. You were able to\ncounter one of his attacks with a knock out hit.
Things moved in slow motion as you saw Riccardo in your corner\nnodding with a sly smile. You followed up your hit with another, \nand another, and another.
You didn't even stop when the man hit the ground. The referee \nhad to pull you away with all he got before you stopped.
The damage had already been done. You had killed a person.
You were devastated by all this, but kept it all inside.
This was only the beginning. Riccardo had plenty of dirty work \nfor you to do and at this point he had plenty of leverage too. Your\nsister being the last resort everytime you hesitated.
Things had to change.
Get rid of Riccardo
Get your sister and flee the country
You learned \c[2]Killing intent\c[0]!
Riccardo was wary of you. He seemed to sense your killing intent \nfrom miles away and that's why he avoided seeing you alone to the \nbest of his abilities.
He was too cocky to consider you a serious threat though.\nAs if he had you under his thumb. That proved out to be a grave \nmistake. For him.
You were to meet Riccardo and a dozen of his henchmen at a local\nclub to discuss another one of your many tasks. You had been\nwaiting for an opportunity to see him alone, but that opportunity\nnever presented itself. 'Fair enough' you thought.
The moment you got to a punching distance, Riccardo had a split-\nsecond realization of what was happening before you knocked him \noff his feet. 
The little rat tried to slither away but you grabbed him by his \nthroat and kept slamming him on the floor until he stopped moving.
In your rage you lifted him up and threw him over the railing. \nHe fell from the second floor to the center of the club's dance \nfloor.
You saw him fall head first to the ground. You had succeeded in what\nyou set out to do. Getting out of the club was secondary.
You had to fight through a mob of Riccardo's goons. Somehow you \nmade it out from the backdoor with only minor injuries and ran \naway as fast as you could.
You learned \c[2]Escape plan\c[0]!
You couldn't find your sister anywhere. Calling her telephone,\nnothing.
You started to suspect that Riccardo had suspected something like\nthis and sent your sister somewhere. You were left with no choice\nbut to confront Riccardo.
You ran away from the crime scene. The problem was that now both\nthe Family and the law enforcement of the city were after you.
Just then you received a phone call from your sister. She had been\nsent to Riccardo's summer villa in the country of Valland some days\nprior.
You explained the situation to her and the two of you decide to\nmeet up in the country of Rondon. There was no possibility of\nyou living in Vatican City anymore.
You had to act fast before the police would catch up on you.\nWhat did you take with you before leaving the city?
Take your luxury products with you
You took 2 \c[2]Blue vials\c[0] and a \c[2]Cloth fragment\c[0]!
You took 2 \c[2]Dried meats\c[0] and a \c[2]Moldy bread\c[0]!
You took a syringe of \c[2]Heroin\c[0] and some \c[2]Pep pills\c[0]\nwith you!
You took the first train that left the country. The destination \nwas an obscure little town called Prehevil in the country of \nBohemia. You had no idea where that place was, but you figured \nyou could plan your trip better once you got there...
No, give me the full text adventure
No, give me the abridged version
You were born and raised in the raging heats of Abyssonia.\nThe continent with a long history embedded with chaos and warring\nfactions.
Those fools. The people around you waged wars over ancient disputes\nand grudges started by long gone ancestors.
But that is how it had always been. The people of Abyssonia held \nancestors and their spirits on a godlike pedestal.
But it's not like it was any better in the north, in the continent\nof Europa. Those fools worshipped ancient deities that none of them\nhad ever even seen with their own eyes.
And they certainly had their disputes as well. A Great War after\nanother. What's worse, their disputes didn't stay within their\nborders. They dragged everyone into their mess.
They had set their eyes on Abyssonia now because of its strategic \nposition in securing an access to oil and other raw materials from \nthe east.
It was only a matter of time before their troops would march on\nyour land.
You were not going to die because some faceless puppeteers chose\nto focus their magnifying glasses on your home country this time.\nDespite your young age, you decided to leave.
Your siblings and mother would mourn your departure. They wanted \nyou to have something to remember them by.
Take your family \c[2]Chac chac\c[0]
Take your father's memento, \c[2]Soul stone\c[0]
You took the \c[2]Chac chac\c[0] with you.
You took the \c[2]Soul stone\c[0] with you. It was said to hold your\nfather's spirit in it.
You had considered yourself as successfully dead inside, not swayed\nby emotions, but it took a lot of effort to convince yourself that\nyou wouldn't miss your family. You still obviously had weaknesses\nto weed out.
You headed to the City of the Sun - Amon to educate yourself on\nspiritualism and religion. You were no slough physically, but you\nalways considered your intellect your true forte.
And just like that you were accepted as an apprentice after some\npreliminary tests. At the same time news about the Great War\nclosing Abyssonian borders were all they could talk on the radio.
Amon was far from the borders and it would probably remain safe\nfor a good while even after a war broke. You figured you'd still \nhave plenty of time to learn at the temple and leave the country\nbefore it was too late.
At the Temple of Amon you were given a choice to learn various \ndifferent schools of spiritualism.
Learn of worship in Europa
Learn magic from Eastern Sanctuaries
Learn methods of your home country
The worship in Europa focused on the older god Alll-mer, but among\nscholars it wasn't too uncommon to worship even more obscure deities.
Learn of Alll-mer
Learn of Gro-goroth
Learn of Sylvian
Learn of God of Fear and Hunger
Learn of Vinushka
Learn of the Moon God
Your affinity with the Alll-mer grew.
Your affinity with the Gro-goroth grew.
Your affinity with the Sylvian grew.
Your affinity with the God of Fear and Hunger grew.
Your affinity with the Vinushka grew.
Your affinity with the Moon God grew.
You learned \c[2]Pyromancy trick\c[0].
You learned \c[2]Meditation\c[0].
You were talented and praised for your quick learning at the temple.\nBut that came as no surprise to you. You knew you were smarter\nthan most of those old geezers. They only possessed knowledge you \nwanted, once you had that, they served no purpose to you.
More time you spent at the temple, more pathetic the priests of Amon\nstarted to look in your eyes. Religion in general started to look \ndubious too after examining how the world functioned.
Most religious doctrines were molded to accommodate the current\nruling class. Religion was used as a mere tool to control masses \nmore than anything else. Dedicating your life to worship would equal \ndedicating your life to kings and queens of the time.
You had left your home because you didn't want to die fighting \nsomeone else's war, so why would you waste your life serving\nsomeone else in turn?
Around this time you found an old scroll from one of the many Amon\nlibraries. The scroll mentioned an old sect of magical practitioners\noriginating from Eastern Sanctuaries whose world view seemed more\nappealing to you.
'Yellow mages' differed from your typical priests. Instead of\ndedicating their lives to worship, gods existed for them. Their\nforce was to be harnessed to further one's own personal growth and \nagenda.
Instead of finding order from the commandments laid out by the\nolder gods, yellow mages reveled in chaos. Chaos was the natural\nstate the world would return to time and time again, so why even\ntry and force it to anything else?
You quit at the temple of Amon and decided to head east in pursuit \nof these 'yellow mages'.
'Need'? Why did you need knowledge and power again? As time went\non this question started bothering you more frequently. You realized \nyou were without a purpose. Without an ideology to fight for.
You quit at the temple thinking that you'd need to forge a path of\nyour own. You had left your home because you didn't want to die\nfighting someone else's war, so why would you waste your time\nlearning to worship someone else in turn?
Most religious doctrines were molded to accommodate the current\nrulers after all. In your eyes religion was used as a tool to \ncontrol masses more than anything else. Dedicating your life to such\nwould equal dedicating your life to kings and queens of the time.
You were above that.
You travelled beyond your home continent, ultimately finding \nyourself at the narrow streets of Eastern Sanctuaries. You got\nacquainted with the local temples. Even they had adopted the worship \nof Alll-mer as their main religion.
Eastern Sanctuaries were no better than the temples of Amon in \nthat regard. If anything, religion was even more prevailevant there\nand dictated the way people were to live and die.
You were looked down upon by the scholars and religious leaders of \nthe area because of your very public opinions. That didn't bother \nyou. You knew better.
In time your conviction convinced the facets you wanted. You were \napproached by a group of travelling mages who wore colourful attires.
The yellow mages that were still around in this day and age were \nreduced to small separate groups wandering around the world to\nstudy all fields of the otherwordly. The group saw the potential in\nyou and offered a place among them.
You liked what you heard and decided to join the wandering group.\nWhat did you specialize in?
Learn basic techniques
Learn more advanced magic
You learned \c[2]La Danse Macabre\c[0], the traditional dance of the\nyellow mages that channels otherwordly powers close to you.
You learned \c[2]Hurting\c[0].
Your path of learning and self-growth knew no end. Your travels\nbrought you to a small bordertown in Eastern Sanctuaries. There you\nmet a curious person. Hadil Azif, a self-proclaimed wizard from the\nfar east.
Despite his pretentious appearance, his family name 'Azif' was \nwell known and even somewhat feared in certain occult circles which\ngave his claims at least some credibility.
He was gathering a group of adventurers to accompany him on a \nperilious quest. He had inherited a map from his late grandfather \nthat was supposed to lead him to the infamous dungeons of fear and \nhunger itself. 
The place used to be a noteworthy location of pilgrimage for many \naspiring mages and priests in the distant past. The yellow mages\nyou had spent time with previously told ominous tales about the\ndungeons as well. 
Initially you dismissed Azif's talks only to be haunted by the most \nbrutal nightmares on the following night. Something was calling for\nyou. You had to witness the place yourself.
You joined the motley crew of adventurers Azif had managed to put\ntogether and travelled through war-torn Europa. Most of the crew \nquit half-way to Rondon because of how difficult it was to cross \nborders during those chaotic times.
The closer to the destination you got, more feverish your dreams\nbecame. The remaining members of your ragtag fellowship were\nvisibly sick from stress and otherwordly pressure that had befallen\non you the moment you set out on your quest.
The breaking point was the day you were to finally arrive at \nthe dungeons. A heavy fog drowned your camp and made navigation\nimpossible. Using compass a did no good as the thing was just\nspinning circles wildly.
Distant growls and howls created unrest. Not that there was any\nneed for that as superstition and constant misfortune had already\nconvinced your fellow travellers that this trip was cursed from \nthe start.
Your companions panicked and scattered to the mist. Azif himself\nhad been sick from constant nightmares for half the trip already.\nYou left him curled up in fetus position in his tent and ventured \nforward on your own...
After walking for a while you started to make out something behind \nthe thick white veil... The mist revealed a structure of some kind...\nThey were medieval ruins of a fortress. Or what had been a fortress\nback in the day. Now they were just a rubble of rock and stone.
Someone had set up modern tents beside the fortress entrance.\nIt looked like an archeological expedition had been studying the\narea somewhat recently. The site looked abandoned now.
The fortress felt menacing the closer you got to it. Its insides\nwere pitch black. No light penetrated the eternal darkness that\nresided in that god-forsaken place. You braved through your initial\nfight-or-flight reaction and walked in.
The dungeons were as dilapitated as their outerior suggested.\nYou cautiously explored the place in a torch light. You didn't get\nfar when you already heard gutteral growls echoing in the empty\nhallways.
You were not alone in the darkness. The morbid tales about the \nruins started to sound more plausible the deeper you got. Maybe\nyou would've turned back too if it wasn't for a strange voice\nechoing inside your head.
Something seemed to be calling you from the depths.
You continued to search the dungeons one room at a time. Most valuables\nhad been looted over time, but behind a collapsed tunnel you managed to\nfind an old bookshelf with a set of books that caught your interest.
Pick \c[2]Skin bible - Gro-goroth\c[0]
Pick \c[2]Skin bible - Rher\c[0]
Pick \c[2]Skin bible - Sylvian\c[0]
You got \c[2]Skin bible - Gro-goroth\c[0]!
The manuscripts all seemed to be part of a bigger compilation and \nyou would have loved to have all of them with you. But you had a \njob to do and you couldn't burden yourself with too much extra \nluggage.
You got \c[2]Skin bible - Rher\c[0]!
You got \c[2]Skin bible - Sylvian\c[0]!
Your initial assesment of the abandoned archeological expedition \nproved out to be wrong. The archelogists were still very much there, \nwandering the hallways as ghoulish husks. The darkness had its way\nwith those people and they were now bloodthirsty monsters.
The thought did cross your mind that the very same could happen to\nyou too if you spent there too long. You had to be hasty in your\nactions.
To deal with the company, you decide to arm yourself once you\nfound the remains of what was once the armory of the dungeons.
Pick the \c[2]Officer sword\c[0]
Pick the \c[2]Iron spear\c[0]
What looked like small ruins from the ground level, turned out to\nhide multiple levels of macabre secrets. You passed through old \ntorture chambers, prisons suspended above a bottomless chasms,\nhuge underground caverns...
All the while the echo in your head became stronger. You were\nclearly getting closer to the source of that mysterious voice.
Finally you found a digging site from caves that were located \nunderneath all the horrors. The archeological expedition had reached\nthat place before succumbing to the darkness.
They had revealed ruins of an ancient city from a stone wall.\nAs you entered the ruins you felt like you entered another time\nentirely. The decor was unlike any culture you were aware of.
What had lead you to the ruins was feverishly calling for you\nbeneath the rocks and rubble. You dug the piles with your bare\nhands.
And there it was.\. The source of the voice.
A burnt and mummified severed head. The head had deep lines running \nacross its forehead. In the place of its eyes were dark and empty \nsockets. The only hair on the head was the sparse moustache under\nits big nose...
"I wasn't expecting a worm like you weaseling its way this deep to\nthe dungeons, but I'll take what I get. All earthworms do after all\nis dig."
"Your garments... Hmph. Maybe you do have more than a camel's spit \nin place of your mind, you are a yellow mage are you not?"
You confirmed the suspicions of this beheaded oddity.
"Figures. That is why a measly maggot like yourself could hear \nmy call... Very well..."
"KNEEL BEFORE ME! For I am your master, Nas'hrah the doom and terror\nof the modern man!"
That name, Nas'hrah... That was a name you were not expecting to\nhear. It was a name even the yellow mages only talked in the darkest\nhours of the night.
Nas'hrah the harbinger of the burning crusade. Nashrah the bringer\nof torment. Nashrah the doom and terror of the modern man...\nThe great wizard from the Eastern Sanctuaries went by many names.
He indeed was your master. For this beheaded wizard was the one who\ngave birth to yellow mages and their ideology. Only that had happened\nover thousand years earlier. There were no records of Nas'hrah for\nat least 500 years.
"Kueh heh hee. I have a task for you my puny pupil. There is a\nman I want skinned alive. After that I want to RIP OFF THEIR SPINES!\nThey will slump before me limp and feeble!"
Your master seemed to be surprisingly up to date with the twists\nand turns the world had taken since his absence. He had a mission\nfor you.
As a yellow mage you were supposed to follow your own ambitions and\ngreed, but there was a lot you could learn from this death-defying\nwizard that could further your knowledge on dark matters greatly...
You decided to play along. You were sure that this "terror of the\nmodern man" was perfectly aware of your reasoning too. That was the\ncommon relationship between a master yellow mage and their apprentice\nafter all.
You were to travel to a small country in the eastern Europa with \nthe beheaded wizard. To a town called Prehevil.
Your master promised events of cosmic proportions. The stars were \naligned for something big to happen. Something that would turn \nthe tides of the world for good.
The head left out details from his story on purpose, but that did\nlittle to bother you. You had just jumped to the deep end of the\notherwordly world. You couldn't have asked for more.
With this little information about the task at hand, how \ndid you prepare for the trip?
Stock up on magical goods
You managed to find 2 pouches of \c[2]Tobacco\c[0] and a \c[2]Condensed lavender\c[0]
You've felt tense since the moment you embarked on this journey.\nEvery night you'd see nightmares of the horrors that would wait you \nin Prehevil...
Whatever the price. The opportunity was too interesting to pass.\nWith mixed feelings you continued onwards.
After walking for a while you started to make out something behind \nthe thick white veil... The mist revealed structures of some kind...
You got to a set of old ruins, or they looked more like a measly pile\nof rubble now. If it wasn't for the dreadful aura eminating from deep\nwithin, you couldn't tell there was anything remarkable about this\nplace whatsoever...
Near the main entrance arch there was a makeshift archeological site\nwith tents and digging equipment. The site looked abandoned. On the \nother side there was a side entrance to the dungeons with stairs\nleading down to the darkness below...
Examine the tents
Head to the main entrance
Head to the side entrance
The archeological site seemed relatively new. Maybe a couple years\nold at tops. There were no signs of people. Whoever had set it up\nhad long abandoned the place too.
All the documents and reports were written in Bremen so you \ncouldn't tell what exactly these people were looking for.
This might have been just a regular archeological excursion that \nstumbled into their certain doom unknowingly. If these truly were\nthe dungeons of fear and hunger, then even in their current state\nthey would surely swallow unprepared tourists whole.
The moment you stepped inside the dungeon walls you felt immense\notherwordly pressure. You understood that the place would drain any\nnormal person to the brink of madness and starvation in a matter\nof mere hours. You had to be efficient about this.
Even if the day was still bright, the darkness seemed to suffocate \nall light and you could barely see anything ahead of you. You lit \nup a torch.
The side entrance was blocked by a cave in. There was no way around\nthe rubble...
Cautiously you walked down the slippery stairs only to find a\ncave in. The hallway had totally collapsed and there seemed to\nbe no way around it.
Buried under the rubble there was an old skeleton in a medieval\nleather armor crushed under a ton of rocks. You didn't want to\nsuffer the same fate with the skeleton so you returned back.
You stood at the vestibule of the dungeons. To your left you saw\na doorway leading to what seemed like a kitchen. There was a small\nroom with old wooden furniture in front of you and to your right \nthere was a closed door.
Check out the kitchen
Check out the room in front of you
Check the door
Go back outside
The room had small stools around a large wooden table covered in \ncobwebs and old stains. At the end of the room there were old \ncupboards and kitchen utilities that had collapsed on the ground.\nThe other corner had a row of wooden barrels.
Check the cupboards
Check the wooden barrels
You found old \c[2]Wheat flour\c[0] that still seemed good.
The barrels might have once stored food items, but that was \nhundreds of years ago. There was nothing useful there anymore.
The room had an old wooden desk in front of a partly rotten flag\nthat hung on the wall. The flag was that of the old Rondon. \nThe opposite wall had half-empty bookshelves facing towards you.
Behind a small pile of rubble you saw a wooden chest covered in\ncobwebs and dust.
Check the wooden desk
Check the bookshelves
Check the chest
Based on some old documents laying on the table it looked like \nthe desk had belonged to an army officer from the late 16th or \nearly 17th century. You examined all the little drawers on the\nside of the table and found a \c[2]Small key\c[0]!
The few books that were still left were all in a terrible condition.\nNone of them looked interesting, but behind a large encyclopedia\nof torture you found an old \c[2]Wine vial\c[0]!
Upon a closer inspection you noticed that the chest's lock was\nbusted. Opening the chest confirmed your suspicions - The place had\nbeen looted long before you ever entered these old ruins.
You were usually able to keep your cool but just the thought of\nsomething living approaching you in this morbid darkness got your\nheart racing.
You tried opening the door but it didn't budge. You considered\nforcing the door open, but then you heard faint noises coming from \nthe other side.
You could have sworn it sounded like something heavy and alive was\nslowly moving towards the door. You had heard rumours of this place\nand you definitely didn't want to confirm whether there was any truth\nto those horror stories or not. You backed away from the door.
You turned around and thought about leaving the darkness, however\nyou feared that you might have never been able to return there if \nyou had left the place. So just to achieve what you set out to do,\nyou decided to stay. As bad as that idea felt to you.
Suddenly you heard loud banging and screeching coming from the\nentrance hall. Adrenaline was rushing through you as you ran back\nto see just what was causing the noise.
The closed door was jolting from its hinges. Something big was\ntrying to force its way through the door. Whatever it was, created\ninhuman gutteral sounds between its swings at the door.
Hide in the kitchen
Hide in the room in front of you
Wait and see what it is
Run outside
You quickly waltzed inside the kitchen and pressed again a corner\nwhere you thought you could stay hidden while still seeing what you\nwere up against.
The door crashed open. You saw a dark silhouette of a gigantic\nmalformed being push from the open doorway. The creature made\ngurggling noises as it slowly wandered to the other room...
You used this chance to sneak past the thing to the dark corridor\nwhere it first came from. Only the creature had clearly gotten used\nto the darkness as it sensed you the moment you got out of your\nhiding spot.
You charged to the unknown darkness without a second thought.
You checked the room for any good spots to hide in and decided to\ncrouch behind a bookshelf. The place gave you a good vantage point\nwhile hiding you in the shadows.
The door crashed open. You saw a dark silhouette of a gigantic\nmalformed being push from the open doorway. The creature made\ngurggling noises as it slowly wandered to the kitchen...
You braced yourself for whatever was to come. You figured that a\ntrained mage like yourself doesn't need to hide from dangers.
The door crashed open and violently a huge malformed beast pushed in\nfrom the open doorway. The creature looked like it could've once been\na human, but the darkness had distorted its features beyond recognition.
The malformed archeologist had extra members pushing through his\ntrousers, some of which had grown talons just to perverse the human\nphysique even further. The beast had noticed you and charged towards\nyou with intense hatred.
Attack it with your staff
Cast Hurting on it
Try to evade and run past it
The creature tried to swing wildly with its arms, but you managed\nto dodge and thrust the sharp end of your staff through the beast's\nribs puncturing its lungs in the process.
To your surprise this did little to slow the creature down. After\ngasping for air for a second it got right back on its feet and\nresumed pursuing you, blood running down in stretched mouth.
The creature tried to swing wildly with its arms, but you managed\nto dodge and finished your chant. You focused all your hatred and \nrage on a small radius around the monster's shoulder which created\na violent vacuum of energy, the void erased everything in its path.
And just like that a lump of flesh was ripped from the upper torso\nof the malformend archeologist.
Instead of risking your life, you decided to head straight to the \ndark corridor the beast had busted through before.
Your attacks were futile. The creature managed to flail you with\nits lumpy arm before you even had a chance to react. You crashed\nagainst a wall and felt your ribs give in.
The beast would've continued pummeling you if it wasn't for the\nblinding light shining from the outside. It was obvious that creature\nhadn't seen daylight in ages. The thing tried to shelter its eyes from\nthe last rays of the sun, this gave you an opportunity to run past it.
You headed straight to the dark corridor the beast had busted through\nbefore.
You turned around and considered leaving the darkness, however\nyou feared that you might never have been able to return there if \nyou had left the place. So just to achieve what you set out to do,\nyou decided to stay. As bad as that idea felt to you.
You ran as fast as you could creating distance to the malformed\nbeast with each step. You couldn't see much in the darkness, but\na doorframe that had light shining through its cracks caught your\nattention.
You tackled the door open and stumbled to an overgrown courtyard.\nQuickly glancing back at the dark corridor, you noticed that the\nbeast was nowhere to be seen. You figured that the last rays of\nthe setting sun still kept it at bay.
You took a breather and slowly walked across the yard. The grass\nhad taken a sickly yellow-ish colour and the setting sun created\nominous shadows as its rays hit the lone gallows standing at the\ncenter of the enclosure.
As you managed to focus your thoughts, you realized that there was\nan additional voice echoing in your head. Something or someone was\ncalling you from the depths of this forsaken fortress.
There was something very curious about this echo. You needed to\nfind its source. Not like you had a choice but to delve deeper as\nthe sun was rapidly setting down stripping you from the last barrier\nthat kept the murderous beast hiding in the shadows.
The courtyard led to another door to the darkness. You pushed \nforward...
You were at the foyer of the dungeons. The hall was large. To your\nleft was a lavatory, to your right there was a long corridor leading \nto total darkness and before you rose a large stairway up...
Check out the lavatory
Check out the dark corridor
Check out the stairway
Your torch lit up a row of grimy old toilet seatings. Old blood\nstains were mixed with what looked like semen. You wondered how\nand why you knew such an exquisite little detail...
Investigate the toilet
Jump down the toilet hole
Return to the foyer
There was nothing much to the toilet holes. They were just what\none would expect them to be.
'I mean why not?' You figured as you slid through the tight toilet\nhole and fell down to the dark pit.
You sank knee deep to the filth and ancient feces. The shit pit\nwas narrow and you barely had any room to adjust your stance.
The only faint light source you had after the torch died out was\nthe small toilet hole you had squeezed through. There was no way\nto climb back up as the walls were covered in slippery shit that\ngave you no grip whatsoever...
Looks like your journey ended before it could ever even properly \nbegin...
Your torch slowly pushed away the darkness as you advanced towards\nthe unknown. The further you got, the stronger the echo inside your\nhead became. You couldn't make out words clearly, but this was\ndefinitely the right direction to head.
A larger room opened up behind a set of rusty iron bars. Your torch\nrevealed humanlike figures that stood still just beyond the radius\nof the light.
Upon closer inspection you noticed that these figures were medieval\niron maidens. Human shaped torture devices that had seen practical\nuse judging from the old stains that had formed from the seeping\nblood of their victims.
The room had numerous other torture devices as well. Most of them\nwould probably be inoperative in this day and age. Among them you\nsaw an old reinforced chest and at the back of the room you saw\na corridor leading to the cells.
Check the corridor
Get back to the foyer
There was nothing more in the chest.
The chest looked old. It might as well have been medieval for all\nyou knew. As you tried opening it you realized the lock was still\nfully functioning. You could open it without a proper key...
Use the \c[2]Small key\c[0]
You opened the chest and found 2 \c[2]Bear traps\c[2]!
The chest looked old. It might as well have been medieval for all\nyou knew. As you tried opening it you realized the lock was still\nfully functioning. You couldn't open it without a proper key...
You felt a cold draft run across the chamber. The draft seemed to\nbe guiding you towards the dark corrider at the end of the room...
Check the dark corridor
You decided to return to the foyer. While walking there you \ncarefully tried to listen for any other possible residents of \nthese dungeons...
You walked past all the contraptions and bizarre devices, each step \nsticking to the old blood covering the floor...
The corridor that opened up was a long one with multiple cell\ndoors covering each side. At the end there were large bars sealing \noff a staircase. Only a rusty old lock stood in your way towards \nthe deeper darkness.
Check the cell doors
Check the gate at the end of the corridor
Return to the torture chamber
All the doors were locked. Your torch barely lit any of the cells\nso there was no telling what was inside of them.
Despite being ancient, the lock seemed surprisingly durable. You\nfigured that you needed a key or something similar to open the\npathway down.
The key didn't fit the lock. The small key had been designed for \nsmaller desks or chests.
You returned to the torture chamber. You wondered if the room had\nseen any use since its heyday in the medieval times. Some of the \nblood and gore seemed awfully recent...
Check back at the cells
You headed back to the foyer.
Loud creaks and groans could be heard behind you. Something big had\njust entered the foyer. You figured it must have been the malformed\narcheologist from before. The sun must have set which made it \npossible for the creature to advance through the courtyard...
The creature must have had your scent as his footsteps clearly \nclosed in on you at a rapid pace. You had to act fast.
The corridor that opened up was a long one with multiple cell\ndoors covering each side. At the end there were large bars sealing\noff a staircase. Only a rusty old lock stood in your way towards \nthe deeper darkness.
You heard the creature charge through the nearby torture chamber,\nknocking over the iron maidens and crashing through the tables and\nchairs in pursuit of you.
As you turned around, your torch revealed the hulking beast right\nnext to you. By then it was too late to react already.
The beast grabbed you violently and snapped your neck like a twig.\nThe last thing your eyes registered was the monster's pulsating\nappendage hanging between his legs. Looks like all this just aroused\nthe beast...
Looks like your story ended before it ever even properly began...
You heard the creature trash the nearby torture chamber. He was\nright on your heels! You couldn't see him in the darkness, but\nyou could sense his intense hatred homing in on you.
The gate was locked with a reinforced lock. You tried to remain\ncool as you hoped for the prison keys to work...
The beast was already charging towards you as you opened the gate\nand slipped inside only seconds before the malformed monster\nsmashed againt the bars.
Violently the creature tried reach for you while making low grunt\nnoises from his swollen throat.
The bars and the gate seemed to hold the beast for now, but you\ndidn't want to stay and find out whether the thing could eventually\nbreak in.
Instead you took the stairs deeper to the darkness. The thought \ncrossed your mind - If darkness had twisted those poor sods to\nbecome mindless beasts, would the same fate await you if you stayed\nat the dungeons for long enough?
The stairs became sticky from old gore and blood the deeper you\ngot. The air was stale and had rotten smell to it.
The voice inside your head got louder. You still couldn't make\nsense of any words but it was definitely calling for you. \nDeeper. You had to get deeper, that much was clear...
You returned to the torture chamber despite knowing what was\nwaiting for you there.
You barely got out of the corridor as the malformed beast charged\nat you with full force. You got violently tackled against the wall\nand lost consciousness.
The wide stairway lead to an old Alll-merian sacrificial altar\nwith a skeleton crucified to it. Next to the altar there was a\nside path leading deeper inside the fortress.
Go back to the foyer
Examine the altar
Check the side path
The stairs felt steeper when going down. Maybe it had something to\ndo with the way the darkness shrouded each step ahead of you. If\nyou didn't know any better, the stairs could have kept on going \nforever until you reached the abyss itself.
The altar was a typical ritual crucifix used to worship Alll-mer\nThe Ascended One. A sacrifice would be put on the cross and their\nblood would slowly be drained for days to come.
Traditionally such rituals were used for protection. Alll-mer would\nlook after the immediate surroundings for as long as the blood was\nrunning down the cross.
The last sacrifice this cross saw must have been this skeleton.\nThere was no blood dripping from the cross anymore, so no protection \nfrom Alll-mer either.
The stairs felt steeper when going down. Maybe it had something to\ndo with the way the darkness shrouded each step ahead of you. If\nyou didn't know any better, the stairs could have kept on going \nforever, until you reached the abyss itself.
The path was a narrow corridor crudely made from misshapen bricks\nand stones. It looked like the floor had collapsed at certain points \nbut you were able to hop over the trench with ease.
A large room opened up before you. The room stood out with its \nfiner decor, spiral floor tiling and its many bookcases covering \nthe walls.
The southend corner of the room had a small doorway shrouded in\ndarkness. The northend corner was more dilapitated with its caved\nin ceiling and all.
Search the bookshelves
Check the doorway
Most of the books that were still left had been growing mold for\nhundreds of years but there were a handful of manuscripts that\nappeared surprisingly new...
All the skin bible entries lured you to browse them. But you tried\nto keep your head cool. You didn't come to the dungeons because of\nthose books.
Your torch slowly lit up the small room and revealed a wooden desk\nwith drawers, a carpet that was from Eastern Sanctuaries judging by \nits patterns and a partly eaten corpse that seemed to be part of \nthe archelogical expedition.
Search the desk
Search the body
Return to the library
The desk was trashed. Someone must have searched the desk.
Most of the valuables had been looted long time ago already. \nOpening a drawer revealed only old and dusty letters of no importance.\.\nExcept something fell from one of the envelopes...
You found a \c[2]White key\c[0].
Most of the valuables had been looted long time ago already. \nOpening a drawer revealed only old and dusty letters of no importance.\nThe bottom drawer however seems to be stuck...
Force it open
You kicked the drawer a couple of times and managed to force it \nopen.
A \c[2]Lucky coin\c[0] rolled out of the drawer.
The corpse belonged to one of the adventurers who had delved here\nwith the archeological expedition. That's what his outfit told at \nleast. It was the traditional safari outfit you had seen in movies.
Someone or something had been chewing on the body. There were\nhuman-like bite marks all over the torso and neck.
You found \c[2]Tobacco\c[0], a \c[2]Blue vial\c[0] and \c[2]Prison keys\c[0]\nafter searching his pockets.
Faint whining and moaning could be heard from the partly eaten \narcheologist. The corpse was trying to get on his feet. As it\nstumbled up, a group of keys fell from his lap.
You picked up the \c[2]Prison keys\c[0].
Faint whining and moaning could be heard from the partly eaten \narcheologist. The corpse had trouble getting back on his feet, \nbut after a small stumble he already turned his attention on you.
Slowly one step at a time the ghoul approched you with his mouth\nstretched unnaturally open...
Ignore it and return to the foyer
You swung your staff at the ghoul. The staff hit the cheekbone of\nthe creature which caved in from the impact, but this did little\nto distract the revitalized archeologist as he took a bite from\nthe handle and yanked the staff from your hands.
You finished your chant and focused all your hatred and fury on \na concentrated spot on the ghoul's soft torso. Like a vortex, the\nenergy tore the archeologist's skin and rotten meat and left a\ngaping hole in their place.
To your surprise the ghoul kept on advancing towards you as if\nnothing had happened. You had never faced a living dead before and\nit seemed like traditional means of harm had very little impact on\nsomeone who felt no fear or pain.
Before managing to attack you tripped to a pile of rubble. As you\nlifted your torch to see, the ghoul already charged towards you \nwith surprising ferocity and landed his teeth on your shoulder.
The momentum of the creature tackled you on the ground where the\nghoul started ripping out your intestines...
You managed to push the creature back just barely and escaped with\nonly a minor injury.
You backed away from the room, yet the ghoul kept on following you.\nYou cautiously hopped over the collapsed floor in the corridor\nleading up to the library. The creature was not as agile and instead\nface planted on the ground as it tripped on the rubble.
The ghoul was waist deep in the trench, unable to climb back up.\nDesperately he tried reaching out for you with his blood soaked hands. \nThe whines and growls turned into agitated shrieks as it furiously \ntried to snatch you.
It looked like the creature was stuck. You figured you'd best \njust leave this area for now and explore elsewhere.
You walked past the collapsed floor, past the sacrificial altar,\ndown the stairs, all the way back to the foyer.
The goul was still stuck in the rubble. It seemed like he wasn't\nable to climb up from the trench. The thing just kept reaching out\nfor you with saliva dripping from his crooked mouth.
You decide to keep your distance and backed away...
You entered a huge chamber full of partly buried skeletons and \nrotting corpses laying about. The ground had a thick layer of \ndried blood and filth which had accrued around the chamber walls \nover the years.
Each step you took echoed to dizzying heights. You couldn't see\nthe chamber ceiling, the walls just rose up forever to the darkness.
There were two staircases in the chamber. One lead to the ground \nlevel you had just escaped, while the other one lead to lower \nlevels. In the middle of the chamber there was a rather new looking \nwooden contraption...
Take the stairs up
Take the stairs down
Examine the contraption
Examine the piles of bodies
You walked up the stairs. The screams of the malformed archeologist\ngot louder and louder until you saw the thing still banging on the\nthe gate relentlessly.
The gate hinges were starting to get loose. It seemed like the \ncreature could have broken in at any moment really. You decided \nto head back down while you still could...
You walked up the stairs. The malformed archeologist was still \nthere banging the gate but looked a lot less enthusiastic about\nit than before.
You still couldn't go back, but at least you weren't on a timer\nanymore. It looked less likely by the minute that the thing would\nbust in anymore.
The stairs leading down were sticky with the grime like everything\nelse in that chamber. A cold draft moved you along to the chasm\nthat awaited you at the bottom.
You didn't notice the gaping hole at the center of the chamber until\nyou got closer and your torch lit up the surroundings. The wooden\ncontraption had been built around it as a freight elevator of sorts.\nLifting and lowering items and people if necessary.
The contraption itself stuck out just by not being stained with\nblood and filth like everything else. Judging by some of the\nequipment around, the elevator must have been used by the same\narcheologic expedition that had set up the tents outside.
You could have used the contraption yourself too if you had some\nrope with you...
The wooden contraption had been built around the gaping hole on\nthe ground. It was used as a freight elevator of sorts. Lifting and \nlowering items and people if necessary.
Use the \c[2]Rope\c[0]
You tied the rope tightly to the wooden beams and threw the loose\nend down to the pit.
A cold draft could be felt coming from the depths below...
You headed down.
Most of the bodies had been decaying and decomposing for hundreds\nof years. Some bodies looked fresher than the others, while some\nwere reduced to bare skeletons.
The ludicrous amount of corpses did raise questions about the\npurpose of this chamber, but there was no one around to answer\nthose questions anymore so you just took everything at face \nvalue.
A giant underground ravine opened up before you. Even your torch\ncouldn't properly light up the area. There were iron grid \nplatforms suspended above a seemingly bottomless chasm. 
The platforms were mounted on cavern walls and linked together \nwith a shaky looking bridge. The side you were on had a few \nindividual prison cells in a row. What awaited on the other side\nof the bridge was shrouded in darkness.
Return to the upper floor chamber
Check the prison cells
Walk over the bridge
Examine the ravine
You walked up the stairs cautiously. The stale and greasy air \ngreeted you upstairs.
You tried opening the cell doors, but all of them appeared locked.\nSome of the locks were too rusty to even function properly anymore.\nThere appeared to be no way inside the bars.
Not that you missed anything important. The torch light revealed\njust regular prison utilities like piss buckets, chains and a \ncouple of skulls belonging to previous residents.
You cautiously walked up to the bridge. Just putting some weight\non the thing caused a couple of nuts and bolts fall down to the \nendless depths.
You braved across it. The bridge felt like it was about to collapse \nat any moment, but somehow it remained together. The other side \nof the ravine was more or less identical to the one where you \njust came.
The grid platforms looked old and rusty. The platforms gave\nworrisome creaks as you walked on them. The fact that parts of\nthe platform had  already collapsed didn't exactly reassure you \nof their condition.
As you walked to the platforms you heard loud screeching from\none of the cells.
The noise was coming from the exact cell you feared it would.\nThe huge creature in the cell had waken up from its slumber.
The noise seemed to come from one of the cells at the end of the\nplatform. Something trapped inside was causing the ruckus.
A large humanoid creature busted through the cell door. The thing\nwas naked revealing its abnormally muscular and scarred physique.\nIts left arm was missing, replaced with what looked like a long\npole or a rod full of thorns and other sharp projections...
The most striking feature however in this abomination was its head.\nThe thing had a head of a crow. And it was not just a mask, the \nfeathers seemed to be growing down its neck as well.
choice_text 1 Attack with your \c[2]Officer sword\c[0]
choice_text 1 Attack with your \c[2]Iron spear\c[0]
You couldn't help but take a few steps back. That strong was the\nkilling intent eminating from the thing.
Attack with your staff
Cast a hurting on it
Try to slip by it
The crow gave a loud kaw that was mixed with a deep resonating \ngrowl of an anguished man and attacked you by swinging its mauling \narm furiously at you.
You managed to dodge the swing and thrust the sword through the\ncreature's side puncturing its ribs.
The crow was apathetic towards your attacks. The sword was stuck\nin its ribs, but it didn't seem to slow the creature down at all.
You grounded the iron spear on the ground and let the creature's\nown weight do the work for you. The crow came at you with such\nforce that the spear impaled its abdomen without slowing it down \nthe slightest.
The crow was apathetic towards your attacks. The creature stood up\nstraight with the spear still jutting out from its gut. The thing\nshowed no signs of pain.
You tried to counterattack the creature's swing with the staff, \nbut it just broke into splinters as the freak arm of the thing \nswung by.
The crow was apathetic towards your attacks. It just kept staring\nthrough you with its lifeless eyes.
You jumped back while chanting the spell. You lifted your hand\nand targeted the creature's chest. You focused all your pent up\nrage on that very spot. You dug deep to all the great wrongs\ndone to you in you short life...
The vortex that followed blasted a clean hole through the creature.
The crow had blood dripping from its gaping wound and its beak,\nbut it kept advancing towards you regardless of its wounds.
You tried to slip past the creature. First you dodged another \nswing coming your way and then leaped on the annexing bridge \njust barely escaping beyond the crow's reach.
You ran across the bridge, the creature followed hot on your \ntrail. The shaky bridge clattered under your feet. Just as you\nmade it on the other side, the whole thing fell to pieces.
The hulking mass of the crow mauler was too much for the antique \nconstruction. The creature slumped down to the endless chasm with \nthe collapsing parts and pieces.
You dodged the initial swing and tried to counterattack immediately\nafter, but unfortunate for you the creature followed its attack by\npecking you with its large beak.
The crow tried to go for your head but only managed to take \na chunk out of your shoulder. It was scary how easily the thing \nmanaged to wound you almost mortally.
If the peck was just centimeters to the left, it would have ripped\nyour arteries.
There were 3 cells in a row. At the end of the platform there was\na corridor leading away from the ravine back to solid ground.
Go to the corridor
Return to the other side
All the cells were locked. One cell in particular caught your\nattention. There was a huge, naked creature inside. Its features\nlooked human but the person must have been at least 2,5 meters\ntall, if not more...
The upper body of the thing was shrouded in darkness...
For a moment you thought the creature was still breathing... \nBut you figured it must have been just the flickering torch \ncreating illusions. Surely.
You walked away as quietly as possible regardless.
You returned to the cell just to check up on the creature. Better\nbe cautious than sorry...
This time you were convinced of it. This thing, whatever it was, \nwas still alive and breathing.
You wondered if the bars and the cell door would be able to hold \nthe creature if it turned out hostile...
The corridor took you to a small intersection. To your left there\nwas a doorway to a small room, and to your right the corridor \ncontinued deeper to the darkness.
Check back on the chasm
Check the small room
Head deeper to the darkness
You heard distant chains rattle by the chasm...
Seems like the small commotion caused by your exploration reached\nthe ears of someone or something...
A loud creak echoed from the ravine...
The dungeons were dead silent apart from the small ruckus caused\nby you going through the officer's room. Whatever still lived in \nthe darkness would hear you loud and clear.
You heard an ear piercing screech. It sounded like a cell door was\njust forced open. Steady scraping sounds closed in on you as you\nfelt a terrifying presence advance in the dark.
Hide behind the wooden desk
You hid behind the desk and tried to get a decent vantage point as\nthe scraping noises grew louder and louder...
A huge humanoid creature entered the room. The thing was naked\nrevealing its abnormally muscular and scarred physique. Its left\narm was missing, replaced with what looked like a long pole or rod\nfull of thorns and other sharp projections...
The most striking feature however in this abomination was its head.\nThe thing had a head of a crow. And it was not just a mask, the \nfeathers were growing down its neck too.
Its empty glaring eyes seemed to stare right through you from the \ndarkness of the doorway.
The crow gave a loud kaw that was mixed with a deep resonating growl\nof an anguished man. That was all the warning you got as it charged\nstraight at you.
You tried to keep a cool head as the scraping sounds became louder\nand louder...
A huge humanoid creature appeared from the dark. The thing was\nnaked revealing its abnormally muscular and scarred physique. Its \nleft arm was missing, replaced with what looked like a long pole or\nrod full of thorns and other sharp projections...
Its empty glaring eyes seemed to stare right through you.
choice_text 2 Attack with your \c[2]Officer sword\c[0]
choice_text 2 Attack with your \c[2]Iron spear\c[0]
The creature swung furiously at you with its left mauler arm.
Try to defend
You tried desperately to defend yourself against mauling arm, but\nit was all in vain. The swing had a terrifying force behind it and\nyou got crushed against the floor, almost losing your consciousness.
You didn't even have time to lift your weapon as the mauling arm\ncrushed you against the floor.
You didn't have time to even start chanting the spell as the \nmauling arm crushed you against the floor.
The creature knew perfectly well how to utilize the dreadful weapon\nas its thorns and spikes scraped the skin of your back.
You were surprised by the mercy shown as the crow finished you \nquickly with just one additional swoop that broke your spine.
The room looked like it had once belonged to an army officer.\nThere were numerous weapon racks in the room positioned next to\nan empty shelf. At the back of the room there was a wooden desk\nwith an impressive looking leather recliner behind it.
Behind the desk you noticed a small cast iron chest and what seemed\nlike a rusty lever.
Check the weapon racks
Check the lever
Return to the corridor
There were few swords and spears still left on the rack. It looked\nlike there might have once been more but looters had probably taken \neverything that looked half-decent and valuable.
One of the swords wasn't complete rubbish and one of the spears \nappeared to be in a surprisingly good shape. You couldn't carry \nboth around. You didn't want to over-encumber yourself after all.
Leave them
You decided to leave them both for now...
The weapon rack looked even more empty now. You figured that the\nnext poor soul to wander down to these ruins could have your leftovers.
The desk and its drawers had been ransacked long ago already.\nInstead you tried looking for things that were less obvious to\ncommon thieves and treasure hunters...
You examined the bottom of the desk and found a hidden trap door.
A \c[2]Pipe\c[0] and a pouch full of \c[2]Tobacco\c[0] fell from the\nhidden compartment.
The desk and its drawers had been ransacked. You didn't even bother\nlooking too carefully as you were sure all the valuables were long\ngone by now.
The chest had a thick and durable looking lock. It must have been\njust that too as it had survived the test of time and undoubtedly\na myriad of looters.
The key fit the lock perfectly.
The chest was almost empty. Only a small ring was laying on the\nbottom. You got \c[2]Thorned ring\c[0]!
You tried forcing it open, but with no luck. If all the thieves from\npast several hundred years had given up on the chest, it would've \nbeen very unlikely that it was you who would've finally been the one \nto break the thing.
There was nothing more left in the chest.
It looked like a mechanical lever used to control something...\nYou tried pulling it, but it was stuck. It didn't budge even a \nlittle.
It was a curious little thing, but its purpose would remain a\nmystery to you.
You torch pushed away the darkness. The dancing light flickered on\na lone skeleton chained on the wall. The corridor circled back\nto the great chasm and its suspended platforms.
The grid iron bridge connecting the two sides had completely \ncollapsed on this end of the ravine.
You noticed a rope tied on the platform. On the other end of the\nrope you saw a corpse belonging to the archeological expedition.\nThis person had apparently hanged himself. The horrors of the\ndungeons must have been too much for him.
Lift up the corpse
Head back
You saw faint shapes in the darkness. The platforms seemed to \ncontinue on the other side. God knows how large this man-made area \nreally was...
You pulled the corpse up.
You were right in your assessment. The person had modern clothing\nthat looked like that of a stereotypical western archeologist.
The person had nothing of value. You did pick up the \c[2]Rope\c[0] though.
Your footsteps were the only thing echoing in the air apart from\noccasional water droplet heard in the distance as you headed back.
There was a doorway to a small room on your right and in front\nof you was the vast open area with all the cells. The prison area.
Go to the small door
Go check out the cells
Head back to the dark corridor
There was nothing there apart from the corpse you had pulled up.
Examine the corpse
You checked all the pockets but found nothing of value.
Walking back and forth the bridge didn't feel like such a good idea.\nIf anything, the bridge felt even shakier than before.
You realized something now that you looked the ravine from the other \nside...
Next to the man-made plaforms, in the darkness, there were huge \nstatues carved on the cavern walls where the brick walls of the\nprison area ended.
The statues were figures from olden times, clad in armor, only\ntheir appearance wasn't that of humans. No, these figures appeared\nmore reptilian.
The appearance and the condition of the statues suggested that they\nwere a lot older than anything that had been built around them over\nthe years. They were probably there even before the whole fortress \nexisted in the first place.
You were standing on a grid iron platform that was suspended above\nthe dark ravine that opened up below you. The bridge that had\nlinked the platform to the other side had collapsed entirely with\nthe crow.
The side you were on had a few individual prison cells in a row\nand a stairway back up where you initially came from.
Check the bridge remains
As you walked back up, you once again heard the echo inside your\nhead. This time you could almost understand some words...
"... Deeper... You must delve... Deeper..."
The correct path must have been somewhere at the bloody chamber.
You walked to the bridge remains and looked down. The chasm was\ndeep. Very deep.
The creature couldn't have survived the fall. That's what you\nkept saying to yourself anyway.
The grid platforms looked old and rusty. The platforms gave \nworrisome creaks as you walked on them. The whole thing seemed \neven shakier now that the annexing bridge had fallen to the pit.
You climbed down the claustrophobic bloody pit. The pit opened \nup and the area that revealed itself was even more open than\nthe ravine upstairs. There was a huge cavern beneath the fortress\nruins.
The rope ended up on top of a crashed wreckage. An iron cage had\ncrashed on the rocky ground from the pit you came from. A closer \ninspection suggested that it was an elevator of some kind. Needless \nto say it wasn't functional anymore.
You stood on solid ground next to the wreckage. The cavern was huge.\nYour torch light left you standing in the middle of darkness with\nno points of interest apart from a makeshift campsite with a couple\nof tents and some archeological equipment.
Climb back up
Examine the elevator wreckage
Check the campsite
Head to the darkness
You looked up the rope. The climb was long. You didn't want to\ngo back and forth many times, so you decided to search the caverns\nfirst before heading back.
The iron frame of the elevator had bent from the fall. There was\nstill a broken chain hanging on the roof. The chain must have lifted\nand lowered the elevator when necessary back when the elevator was\nstill functioning.
As you walked up to the tents you noticed that there were no signs\nof life there. The archeological crew was gone.
The campsite had a couple of tents side by side, open crates \nfull of digging equipment and a makeshift table full of various\ndocuments scattered around. Behind the camp you found a larger\ndigging site.
Go back to the elevator wreckage
Check out the tents
Check out the documents
Go to the digging site
You turned around and decided to check up the wreckage once again.
The first tent had sleeping bags and clothing scattered about.\nAmong the useless junk you managed to find 5 \c[2]Matches\c[0]!
The second tent was mostly the same story except there was a \ncollection of archeological findings on a table.
After your initial excitement you noticed however that those \nfindings were only run-of-the-mill artifacts, pieces of broken\nvases and other trinkets of no use.
Among the junk you picked up an \c[2]Ornament lantern\c[0].
The first tent had sleeping bags and clothing scattered about.\nUseless junk for the most part.
Too bad the findings were only run-of-the-mill artifacts, pieces \nof broken vases and other trinkets of no use.
Only... This time you noticed something hidden under a sleeping bad.\nSomeone from the archeological crew must have tried to hide it from\nthe others.
You found a \c[2]Small thing's amulet\c[0]!
The documents were written in Bremen, so you couldn't make sense\nof them really. There were some very official looking papers among\nthem which suggested that the expedition orders came from someone\nhigh up in Bremen office. Maybe even from the Kaiser himself?
A report documented each item found from the digging site. There\nwere pictures of the said items etched on paper. The items looked\nmundane for most parts, but all of them had carvings on them that\nwere unlike anything you had seen before.
They didn't match with any culture you were aware of.
One document caught your interest especially. It had a sketch of a \ncubic object with various ornaments and sigils carved all across it.
Something about this item raised the hair on your arms and made\nyou sick from stomach. There was something special about this cube, \nno doubt about it...
The digging site was bigger than how it looked initially. The site\nexpanded to nearby cliffs with wooden platforms leading down to a \ndark chasm.
Go back to the campsite
Go down the wooden platforms
You descended down to the dark depths. The echo inside your head\nreturned once again. '...Misguided soul, can't you hear my call...?'\nThe words were clear this time around.
"Good... Finally..." The voices became ever more clearer.
The archeological crew had been digging deep and revealed something \nthat should've stayed hidden. Ancient structures could clearly \nbe seen protruding from the rocky surface.
The structures looked almost like remains of a city from another\ntime. The wooden platforms took you straight to them and a ladder\nwas set to lead you inside what looked like a temple or some other\nplace of worship.
You climbed in.
Most of the temple was dilapitated by the time, but you could still\nspot some murals on the walls that depicted rituals and gods not \nknown in this day and age.
Even if you only witnessed glimpses of something larger, the scale\nof the building already impressed you. It was unlike anything you\nhad ever seen. Eastern Sanctuaries, The city of Amon, Abyssonia...\nThey all paled in comparison.
The voice inside your head was getting loud. 'This way. This way.\nThis way. This way! This way! THIS WAY! THIS WAAYYY!'
You dug the rubble with your bare hands. You turned over wooden\nstructures and pushed away a stone pillar...
A burnt and withered head. A severed head to be more precise.
The head had deep lines running across it. In the place of its \neyes were dark and empty sockets. The only hair on the head was \nthe sparse moustache under its big nose...
'I wasn't expecting a worm like you weaseling its way this deep to\nthe dungeons, but I'll take what I get. All earthworms do after all\nis dig.'
'Your garments... Hmph. Maybe you do have more than a camel's \nspunk in place of your brains, you are a yellow mage are you not?'
'Figures. That is why a measly maggot like yourself could hear \nmy call... Very well...'
'KNEEL BEFORE ME! For I am your master, Nas'hrah the doom and \nterror of the modern man!'
'Kueh kueh. You are a lucky bastard. Lucky indeed.'
'There is a man I want skinned alive... After that I want to\nRIP OFF THEIR SPINES! THOSE MAGGOTS! They will \nslump before me limp and feeble!'
As a yellow mage you were supposed to follow your own ambitions\nand greed, but there was a lot you could learn from this\ndeath-defying wizard that could further your knowledge on dark \nmatters greatly...
You decided to play along. You were sure that this 'terror of the\nmodern man' was perfectly aware of your reasoning too. That was\nthe typical relationship between a master yellow mage and their\napprentice after all.
You started walking to the darkness with your torch working as the\nonly source of light. As you walked away from the wreckage the voice\nechoing inside your head became more distant. The further you got\nthe more aggravated it got too.
Whatever was the source of these voices, it obviously didn't want \nyou to go this way.
Keep on walking
Go back to the wreckage
You decided to turn back before getting lost in the darkness.
You walked straight until you ran into a rock wall. The wall rose \nup beyond the radius of your torch light.
Head back to the wreckage
Continue along the wall
You were a bit unsure about the direction, but luckily you chose\nthe right way and found yourself back where you started.
You kept walking. The ground was pretty even and in general the \nterrain was fairly easily traversable.
Pretty soon you found yourself at the edge of an cliff. The sight\nreminded you of the ravine upstairs. Most likely the chasm before\nyou was the very same.
The place looked like a dead end, so you traced back your \nfootsteps back to the elevator wreckage.
That proved out to be more difficult than you expected. The ground\nwas hard so there were barely any footsteps left on it. After\nmeandering about for a good while, you stumbled upon the wreckage\njust by sheer accident. Lucky you.
You hear voices echoing from the beheaded wizard...\n\c[7]"We're in 'his' radius now. Better not let me down now."\c[0]
You were always a curious child. Your elder siblings and your nanny\nhad to keep you out of the harm's way to the best of their\nabilities. Just a moment's lapse in their vigilance and you'd be\nrunning behind a corner for one of your many misadventures.
Your parents were always busy. They had very little time for you\nand your brothers, instead you were mostly raised by Dalia, the\nnursemaid of the household. A tall woman in her 30s originating\nfrom the Eastern Sanctuaries.
In your memories she was alright, but something always felt 'off'\nabout her...
Your parents were fresh aristocrats in the Bremen Empire. Despite\nbeing highly thought of, they were outsiders among the noble for\nthey had risen to power by their own means and thus didn't have\nstrong roots among the other blue blood of Bremen.
This proved out to be a problem when tensions within Bremen borders\nwere rising with different factions rising to prominence around the \ncountry.
The situation looked bad for your family as you didn't have\nstrong lineage to back you up. When the time came to throw someone \nat the wolves to please the general public, the Sauer family was \nthe first to go.
Certain populist factions were able to agitate the common people to\nstart riots and a huge mob headed towards your family manor.
In a hurry your parents gave you to Dalia's safe keeping and told\nher to leave the country. They would look you up when things had \nsettled down.
Or that's at least what Dalia told you afterwards. You were still a bit\nyoung to remember properly. But you could've sworn that Dalia never \nconsulted your parents about your departure.
In your memories Dalia just flat out kidnapped you.
Whatever the case, you and Dalia travelled to Jettaiah, the capital of\nthe Eastern Sanctuaries, recently named Eastern Union after they\njoined forces with the Voroniyan Republic.
The culture shock was quite drastic, you had never seen such poverty\nand such riches, side by side in the street view. All the unfamiliar\nsounds and scents from spice vendors that circled your automobile...
It was all too much for you as you were growing restless by the\nminute. Dalia struggled to contain you as you opened the car door \nand jumped out of the moving vehicle.
Convince passersby that you've been kidnapped
Run through the crowded streets and hide
You learned \c[2]Persuade\c[0]!
Despite the language barrier, you managed to convince some of the\npeople of your distress. Once Dalia came following with her excuses,\nshe had a lot of convincing to do to get the people give you back to\nher.
Dalia tried to assure you that you had nothing to worry about, but\nonce again she gave that 'off' feeling. You didn't know what it was,\nbut you seemed to have a sixth sense when it came to judging people's\ncharacter and honesty.
But there was not much you could do. You were still considered just a \nchild after all.
You threaded through the crowds quickly and gracefully. All the years\nof playing tag with your brothers paid off. You shook off Dalia with\nease.
However once the evening came and you grew hungry, you weren't so\ncertain about your plan anymore.
You heard Dalia yell for you tirelessly even after all these hours.\nYou decided to give yourself in and reveal your location. You were\nstill just a child after all, what were you going to do instead?
So you ended up living with Dalia in a rather decent looking building.\nShe was cashing cheques to maintain your lifestyle.
Dalia's version of the truth was that your parents were looking \nafter you by sending money, but you had a feeling that it was \njust ransom money Dalia kept spending.
It wasn't all bad though. Growing up in the Eastern Union gave you\nsome perspective at the very least.
The way the local authority oppressed the locals made you wary of\nthose in power. In your teenage years you started spending more time\nwith various civil rights organizations that were active in Jettaiah.
During one of the weekly protests the local army decided to make\nan example of your group. Without mercy the armored officers \npummeled brutally those in the first rows of the demonstration.
Help those who were wounded
Grab a pistol from one of the officers and defend yourself
Run away
Lucky you had prepared for situations like this and you had various\nfirst aid item with you.
You got 4 \c[2]Cloth fragments\c[0] and 2 \c[2]Blue vials\c[0]!
You tried to bandage one of your unconscious comrades, but the army\nofficers reached you in no time and proceeded to beat you to the\nground.
You got a \c[2]Lugr pistol\c[0] and 6 \c[2]9mm Bullets\c[0]!
You noticed an unconscious army officer on the ground. You picked \nup his pistol in a hurry, pointed the gun at the opposing forces \nand shot.
You managed to hit one of the officers, but you only managed to shoot \nhis thigh. In return he answered your fire with fire and shot you in \nthe abdomen. You fell down immediately. The pain was excruciating.
You were able to push through the panicking masses that were all\ntrying to escape from the narrow streets. You knew these alleys well\nand in no time you got back to you flat where you resided with Dalia.
Unfortunately a foreigner like yourself stood out in the protest and\nsoon you had army officers at your doorway. With great force they\npushed you on the ground which knocked you out immediately.
You woke up in the hospital. There were people from the Bremen \nembassy waiting for you to wake up. Apparently the protest had\ngained some publicity and they had noticed you on a television.
You explained your situation to them and they took you in their \ncustody. Soon you were already on a plane flight headed back to\nBremen.
You were returned to your mother and her new husband. The rioting \nmobs had burned down your family manor all those years ago and \nyour father had died during the unrest.
You never heard of Dalia again, but apparently she had indeed \nkidnapped you and you were living off of ransom money your new \nstepfather had barely been able to put together. Your sixth sense\nseemed to be working as intended.
Your turbulent life had left a mark in you and you had trouble staying\nstill for too long. Instead of settling down properly, you became a \njournalist at a very young age.
The situation in Bremen seemed very suspicious to you. A mysterious\nperson only known as 'Kaiser' was appointed the chancellor of the \nBremen Empire without any prior involvement in the country's \npolitics.
He had appeared seemingly out of nowhere and taken control of \nthe whole country.
Kaiser was partly responsible for what happened to your father as\nit was him who had been riling up people against the nobility of the\ncountry. But it wasn't just that. You also got major 'off' vibes from\nthis person. That's why you dug deep to uncover his past.
Nothing seemed to make sense though. There were connections \nbetween Kaiser and a so-called secret society called 'The New \nGods', but that started to sound like a petty conspiracy theory \nthe more you read into it.
Still, your sixth sense was tingling. The New Gods were a group that\nhad been talked about since the Cruel Ages of history. They were the\ntypical secret society, controlling different nations from behind the\nthe curtain and puppeteering those seemingly in power.
There were several people in modern global politics linked to this\ngroup. The more you investigated the subject, the more it started to\nlook as if this group was behind the last two great wars that had\nravaged the world. Something big was definitely brewing in Europa...
When Kaiser occupied Prehevil, the capital of Bohemia only to shortly\nafter make a truce with the Eastern Union - that's when your alarm \nbells started to ring loud.
Something was definitely 'off'. You decided to take off and travel\nto Bohemia yourself.
With this long trip ahead of you, how did you prepare for the trip?
Stock up on self-defence items
You managed to buy 5 \c[2]9mm Bullets\c[0] and a \c[2]Fencing gambeson\c[0]!
You managed to buy \c[2]Lugr pistol\c[0], 5 \c[2]9mm Bullets\c[0] and\na \c[2]Fencing gambeson\c[0]!
You remember moths, blue moths - blue noctuid moths to be precise.\nThat is your first memory as a child. You and your twin sister sitting \nin the backyard, illuminated by the cold blue hue of the moon.
Instances where it was just the two of you, sharing a moment, were\nrare. That is probably why those moments matter you the most.
You and your twin sister were born at the strike of midnight, at\nthe turning point of months. Thus you were born with different \nbirthsigns.
One was born with a shadowed soul and one with a radiating soul.
Since that moment it was evident that the two of you would lead very\ndifferent paths in life. Just as predicted, you were the polar opposites \nof each other from very early on.
You were fragile and weak in build, whereas your sister Reila was \nan active and adventurous child that could have easily been an \nathlete if she just chose so.
You stuck indoors reading books for the most of your time. Your \nsister spent her time outside making friends with other kids of \nthe neighbourhood.
Despite your differences, you took solace from each other in the\nstrict religious household you grew up in. One thing was common\nbetween the two of you - You both wanted out of the everwatching\neye of your parents and their religious dogma.
You found escapism from the nature and botanism. Your sister, also\nbeing academically gifted, took interest in sciences. She would\ndedicate her time to new sciences that centered around advanced \nengineering and top of the line technology.
Her taking interest in the academia did irk you a little bit. As \nif she had stepped into your territory.
Give in to jealousy and try to outdo her in science
Stick to botanism
You decided to not give your sister the satisfaction of being the\nbooksmarts of the family. You snagged her books and tried to catch\nup to her level.
Unfortunately you had no natural knack for the subject and had to \nforce yourself to concentrate.
Ultimately you did learn \c[2]Short circuit\c[0]!
One night your sister noticed you reading through her books. \nYou were afraid of her reaction. Instead she tried to help you \nunderstand the charts and diagrams better.
Noticing the stark difference between the two of you, you decided to\ngive up on the subject and got back to studying botanism.
Getting back to the natural world felt like a relief and you \nrealized that's what you were born to do in this world.
You decided to concentrate on your own doings instead of giving in\nto the jealousy and it quickly beared fruit.
You learned \c[2]Undergrowth awareness\c[0]!
While occupying yourself with the world of botanism, your sister\nwould often quietly join your reading sessions burying herself \ninto her own books.
Despite your differences, these reading sessions really created a\nstrong bond between the two of you.
During your highschool years a disaster struck. You suffered \nmultiple small strokes in a short period of time and was left \nbedridden. Naturally you were terrified by what could have been \ncausing this.
Your parents first turned to religious healers for aid, but\nnothing seemed to work. Your sister tried to persuade them to seek\nout modern doctors, but your parents were slow to react to her\npleads. 
After getting no results your parents finally gave in, but it was\ntoo late at that point. The diagnosis was that you had an abnormality \nof the spinal cord that affected the blood flow and its supply.
You underwent a long operation in hopes of fixing the issue, but\nunfortunately things didn't go well and you were bound for\nwheelchair for the unseeable future. If something had been done\nsooner, maybe things could've been different...
What followed was an intense period during which you tried many \ndifferent medical treatments, all for nothing. There was no\nescaping the wheelchair. Your legs did have some minor function,\nbut they were left far too weak to carry your weight properly.
The world felt like such an unfair and hostile place after all you \nhad gone through.
All this just further created contrast between you and your sister.\nYou couldn't help but be envious of her. Her life seemed to roll \nforward without hiccups of any kind whereas you struggled with each\nstep you took quite literally.
Nevertheless, the two of you continued if not on the same path, \nthen on the same lane at the very least as you both entered the \nsame university in Bremen.
Naturally you were studying botanism and natural sciences and \nyour sister studied new computer sciences and engineering.
You both were tremendously relieved. You had finally moved out \nof your parents' sphere of influence.
Like always, you and Reila were the polar opposites. Why would \nhave things been any different in the university?
You had trouble getting acquainted with other students, but your\nsister on the other hand was already leading the student council and\nwas even getting very familiar with one of the university professors.
Try to steal the affection of the professor
Just concentrate in your own studies
Expose the professor to his superiors
Seeing how Reila and your professor exchanged looks made jealously\nrear its ugly head once again.
Not giving the two a chance to meet up, you insisted that the \nprofessor would come for a dinner with you. You had some important \nthings to discuss...
The professor, while a little confused, did accept to your invitation.\nThe only problem was that you had never cooked in your life. Lucky \nyou had the university library at your disposal.
You get \c[2]Recipes of the 15th Century\c[0]!
But alas, your social skills being what they were, nothing came out\nof it. It seemed like the professor and your sister were destined \nto end up together.
You learned \c[2]Advanced botanism\c[0]!
Just as you expected, your sister and the professor had an obvious\nconnection. You were not sure whether you felt jealous for the fact\nthat your sister garnered the attention from the opposite sex or\nthat someone else was forming a connection with her.
Either way, you didn't think too much about it. It wasn't all bad\nanyway as you made good friends with the professor through your \nsister.
Your student life continued smoothly, you were constantly ranked \ntop of your class and the nature seemed to lift its veil of secrets \nthe further you got in your studies.
Your sister did even better at school. Apparently she was practically\na genius in her field. She took part in a special student exchange\nprogram between the Bremen Empire and the Eastern Union.
She would get to see the world, while you were stuck on your \nlaurels. Nothing new there you pondered.
In any case, the time had come for you to choose where you would \nspecialize in your botanical studies. 
Specialize in folkloristic side of botanism
Specialize in toxicology
You get the \c[2]Skin bible - Vinushka\c[0]!
You learned \c[2]Toxicology\c[0]!
You graduated, started your own research in botanism while also\nworking at the biggest greenhouse in Bremen. What should've been\na brand new start in life felt more like you falling into place to\ngather moss. Living your life through your sister's amazing tales.
Her research abroad seemed to open many doors for her. The Eastern\nUnion hired her to work in top secret facilities around the central \nEuropa.
You would receive letters from her frequently, always from a\ndifferent country. She could never fully reveal what she worked\non, but she did say that despite working for the army, her inventions\nwould be for the better of mankind, not for war.
It all sounded incredible and you were genuinely happy for her. \nReally. Only the letters came to a halt all of a sudden. You wouldn't \nhear from Reila for months.
After 6 months, your parents got information that Reila had been\naccused of treason. She had committed serious crimes against Bremen\nEmpire. That's at least the official story. By the time you heard of\nthis she had already been in an undisclosed Bremen prison for months.
You felt helpless. There wasn't much you could do. The next time you\nheard of her was when you read news about a terrorist group called\n'Nameless Liberty Underground' breaking her free from prison.
What had your sister gotten herself into? A terrorist organization?\nThe news really bothered you. You had definitely heard of the \n'Nameless Liberty Underground' before. But where...?
Then you remembered it. The professor Reila had been seeing during \nher school years had mentioned the organization in a passing \ncomment.
You investigated where the professor had gone after getting fired\nfrom the university only to find out that he had been executed \nseveral months prior. He too had been accused of treason and had \nbeen sentenced to be hanged in the middle of a battlefield.
Something weird was definitely going on.
You returned to the university to confront the professor. Only to\nfind out that he had been executed several months prior. He too\nhad been accused of treason and had been sentenced to be hanged in\nthe middle of a battlefield.
You got to search through his office and found several letters from\nReila. Apparently the two had been in a letter correspondence long \nafter Reila had graduated.
In the last letter from her, Reila had cryptic writings about 'a cube'.\nEastern Union had been 'desperately trying to replicate the cube, but\nto no avail'. Whatever that meant.
Reila was worried that 'the operation in Prehevil' was what Kaiser\nof Bremen Empire was after. 'There is still time before he could\nget here. I still have time.' Those were Reila's last words.
Upon further investigation you found out that Prehevil was a medium\nsized city in the country of Bohemia. That is the last known location\nof your sister. And that is where you decided to head without delay.
With a real adventure ahead of you, how did you prepare for the \ntrip?
Find something to read for your travels
Stock up on herbs
You managed to find the \c[2]Alchemillia vol.1\c[0]!
You managed to find 2 \c[2]Green herbs\c[0], 2 \c[2]Blue herbs\c[0],\n2 \c[2]Lavenders\c[0] and a \c[2]Red herb\c[0]!
Was that... your sister?
An empty barrel.
The hallway is blocked by these chairs...
You could use the \c[2]Manor key\c[0] here?
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Newcomer... newcomes... then the new goes..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Just in time... For dinner."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Sit down."
Sit down
"I don't have time for this."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"You better make time... I am the mayor now after all... The\nmayor is inviting you to a candle light dinner."
"I'm in a hurry to get to the city."
"Fine."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"No one goes to the city past me anymore... I hold the key..."
"Maybe I can make time for a dinner..."
"I need the key."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Good..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"That's too bad..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"What... you shrimp!?"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"WHAT'S THE MATTER SHRIMP!? You don't feel honoured \nin my presence...?"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Is my invitation not good enough for your fancy ass?"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Newcomer... Isn't it peaceful here?"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"I am glad to see you're not a complete looney yet, unlike\nthose others... You saw those people didn't you?"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"One can only wonder what happened to the folks around these\nparts..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"They've drifted far from humanity. Only thing they seem\ninterested in is scavenging the scraps around the old town."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"How am I to have in-depth discussions with them? I want to\ntalk about poetry, music... and culinary arts..."
"What happened here?"
"You don't seem so normal yourself either..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"We are in the same boat here, my friend... I don't have the\nanswers."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"I heard the Bremen military meddled with something..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Some say the moonlight scorched this earth into something\nunrecognizable..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"And the town folk say... it's always been this way..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"What are you talking about!?"
"Nevermind, I mean no insult!"
"Your antlers for starters..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"You make no sense."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"You don't come barging in to other folk's houses and call \nthem weirdos."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"You seen yourself? What kind of adult man uses overalls?"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"You seen yourself? You'd be fine, if it wasn't for that\ndisgusting pierced piehole of yours."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"What exactly are you suggesting!?"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"You come to my dinner table just to insult me!?"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Newcomer... You haven't touched the food yet..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"These are rare delicacies you can only find in Prehevil..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"I've travelled from afar just to experience them..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Pick these for example... Don't they look absolutely\ndelicious..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Use your imagination..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Food can be as inspiring as the highest forms of painted art\nor the most complicated musical arrangements..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"What comes to your mind when you look at these\ndangling beauties?"
"Meatballs."
"Kidneys."
"Embryos."
"Cotton candy."
"Duality of the mind."
"They look disgusting!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Meatballs... Surely you have never visited Prehevil before."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Such common courses are not dealt around these parts..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"I understand where you're coming from... But you don't need \nto look at them so literally..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"The beginning and the end of life... I like your way of\nthinking..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"They sure don't taste like cotton candy..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"I wonder if such salty treats are going to waste with the\nlikes of you..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Now you're just showing off... What the hell is that supposed \nto even mean?"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Are you even taking this seriously?"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Do not insult the heritage of the Prehevil... This is their \nculture..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Some words are better left unsaid."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Let's see... Yes..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"What about this little squirmy thing... What\ncomes to your mind?"
"Local sausage."
"Snakes."
"Male genitalia."
"I dare not say..."
"Your antlers."
"Get that thing off my face!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"In a way, yes... It requires extra-ordinary amounts of time\nto cook."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"However, boil it for too long and it will be too chewy..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Slithering on the ground... Yes... The deceiving one..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Such vulgar talk! On my dinner table!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Oh... But I insist!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Now why the hell would you say something like that?!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"I get a feeling you are not enjoying this dinner..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"But to refuse the delicacies... I spent all day making this\nspecial meal..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"This one is my favourite..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"This peculiar fungus... What is the first thing \nthat comes to your mind?"
"Just an ordinary mushroom."
"Nudity."
"Family."
"Rainy day."
"Coitus."
"I've had enough!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"There is nothing ordinary in my cookings!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Goddammit! You are not even tasting the food! How can you\ninsult the food without tasting it?!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"The surface of the mushroom is as silky as the butt cheeks\nof a virgin, yes."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"... We do not talk about family on this table..."
The atmosphere on the table became very cold suddenly.
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Mm... I can see that. You can still smell the damp forest\nfloor..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"What kind of dirty mind do you possess?"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"You've had enough when I say so!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Hmm... I don't know about you... But I'm full."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"I thank you for the company."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"From what I understand... You are needed in the city..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"I do have the key, however... I have one last question..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Do you support the Bremen army? Are you A Man O' Kaiser so\nto speak?"
"I don't know what you are talking about."
"I support the Bremen army."
"I fight against the Bremen army."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"You truly are a newcomer..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"I'm afraid you are not the kind I was hoping for..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Ha ha... Yes..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"You have my support..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Here... the key is yours..."
You get the \c[2]Lion brass key\c[0]!
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"The other key is with the army I'm afraid..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Please be discreet... I do not wish to start trouble with\nthe Kaiser..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Do not mention my part in this."
You find the \c[2]Lion brass key\c[0]!
You find the \c[2]Manor key\c[0]!
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"The sleepy one!"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"We meet again."
"How's it going?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Oh, you know, just hanging around."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"In a locked room."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Being all kidnapped and stuff."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Not too shabby."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Locked up in a fancy room."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"You know, just a normal tuesday kidnapping."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"But enough about me. How are you doing?"
"Who locked you here?"
"I'm doing alright."
"Struggling to be honest..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"The so-called 'Mayor of the Old Town'... But you just know that's\nbullshit."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"He's a newcomer just as we."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Something very messed up has happened to him."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"A random decrepit priest dragged me by my hair and locked me up here. \nI just went to ask something from him and he attacked me."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"He was spouting some nonsense about ritual crucifixion... I didn't\nespecially like the sound of that."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"He looked off. Something very messed up had happened to him."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Something very messed up has happened to everyone in this town!"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"I don't get it... This is my hometown... It surely wasn't this\nbad when I last saw the place."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"It has always had its fair share of creeps and religious zealots,\nbut this is a new high. Or new low, however you want to put it."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"That's nice. Surprising even. To be honest, I haven't gotten the\nnicest welcoming party..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"There is something very wrong about this place..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Yeaah... Feels bad man."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"I think... It's time to pack our bags for good."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Do you mind if I stick with you for now?"
"Not at all."
"Sorry, I got other plans..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Nice."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Oh."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Well..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Well I suppose I can manage on my own too."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Take care sleepy one."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Seeing as you guys got it all cozy in that big party of yours..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"I'll be going now."
There is a ladder to downstairs here...
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\n"My master is waiting for you at the dining room."
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\n"Proceed upstairs, if you will. Turn left and then to your \nright."
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\n"Please do mind your manners. It would be advised not to\nmention master's antlers for example."
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\n"Good afternoon miss."
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\n"Good afternoon mister."
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\n"From what I understand, you are a newcomer to this town too, no?"
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\n"We just got a new mayor to the old town. I am sure he is thrilled\nto start his business immediately by meeting the newcomers."
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\n"Please, he is waiting at the dining room."
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\n"Proceed upstairs, if you will. Turn to your left and then to your \nright."
\>\i[73]\}EEVES\{\<\n"I hope you had the most pleasant meal."
There is a towering waiter greeting here.
Looks like there's someone's seat here...
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"Newcomer..."
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"So you've decided to play by their rules!"
\>\i[76]\}AYOR\{\<\n"This is how you repay my kindness!?"
The hallways seems to be blocked here...
\>\i[71]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"For Alll-mer's sake!!"
\>\i[71]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"You startled me!"
\>\i[71]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"Don't go sneaking up on me like that kid!"
\>\i[71]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"Don't go sneaking up on me like that doc!"
\>\i[71]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"I'm always happy to see your glorious figure love, but give me\na little warning next time, alright?"
\>\i[71]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"Don't go sneaking up on me like that!"
\>\i[71]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"Now if you'd excuse me..."
You unlocked the doorway.
The priest is fixated on the pearl. He seems to be completely oblivious\nof you...
"What's so special about the pearl?"
\>\i[67]\}ECREPIT PRIEST\{\<\n"..."
You took the \c[2]Priest's head\c[0] as a trophy!
The hole looks too tight to climb through, but you are wondering \nwhere the roots of this pale tree go...
The bed looks comfy and relatively clean...
You feel strong killing intent through your sleep...
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"Time to wake up you piece of shit!"
You recognize the person.
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"We are now finally going to have a little one-to-one."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"Talk."
"What do you want?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"What do I want!? Rich. Very rich."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"Who sent you?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"Is it Accardo!?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"You're one of Accardo's fucking soldiers! I recognized your ugly\nass mutt face the moment you came walking from the train cabin!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"Didn't have balls to act right there in front of all the people?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"Fucking pussy! Pussy full of maggots!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"You got some nerve!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"What's the matter!? I need to beat some sense to you before you\nopen that little mouth of yours!?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"GODDAMNIT!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"WHO SENT YOU!?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"Accardo!?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"One wrong move, one wrong word and you're a goner!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"Start talking!"
"No one sent me here, I'm not doing Family errands here!"
"You wouldn't believe me anyway..."
"Why would someone send me after you?"
"I don't know what you are talking about..."
You read his mind...\n\c[1]"As if."\c[0]
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"BULLSHIT!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"The world just happens to be small enough for us to run into\neach other out here in the middle of - goddamn - nowhere!?"
"Yes. That's right."
"I don't know what to say, that's the truth..."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"This funny to you?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"Nothing swipes a smile off someone's face like a lead pipe!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"I'll ask once more. ONCE MORE!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"BULL - FUCKIN' - SHIT!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"I don't know what's your plan here, but this ain't it chief."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"This will only get your skull smashed in."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"You should know this well enough."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"So, once more... But only once."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"I got no humour for this."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"Well you got shit to lose at this point!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"Talk!"
"I abandoned The Family. I'm running away from Vatican."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"That so?"
Caligura is measuring your words and looking intensely in your\neyes...
You read his mind...\n\c[1]"You don't say...? Is this guy shitting me?"\c[0]
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"A fucking pussy. That's what you are!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"Family life's too hard for you?"
Caligura looks to be thinking what to do next.
You read his mind...\n\c[1]"He does look genuine..."\c[0]
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"Why this place!? Why'd you come to this shithole out of all the\nplaces in the world!?"
"No reason. Just took the first train that departed Vatican."
"Why are you here?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"Dumb fuck."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"You really are as dim-witted as you look."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"You think I'd believe that for a second!?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU HERE!?"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"Better come up with better excuses."
"I told you the truth."
"Fine, you got me. Accardo sent me."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"Now what am I supposed to do with you?"
You read his mind...\n\c[1]"Maybe he really isn't after me...?"\c[0]
You read his mind...\n\c[1]"Look at this ugly fuck... Shit..."\c[0]
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"I'll be keeping my eye on you."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"You better remember where your loyalties lie. I spared your ass \nright here and now."
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"That doesn't happen often. Consider yourself among the lucky ones."
Caligura is trying to measure the honesty of your words...
You read his mind...\n\c[1]"This guy... That was an obvious lie. I can tell that much."\c[0]
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"FUCK! SHIT! FUCK!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"I can see a mile away you're just pulling that shit out of your ass!"
\>\i[66]\}ALIGURA\{\<\n"So you're not here because of The Family..."

You are not going to sleep in the presence of these remains and\ngore.
You are not going to sleep in the same bed with the corpse of this\nmonster.
The tableware is just collecting dust here. Looks like these\nhaven't been used in ages.
The cupboard is almost empty. There are only few small coins\ninside it.
You find 2 \c[2]Shillings\c[0]!
The cupboard is empty.
Books about economy and leadership. They're not going to\nhelp you now.
You can see city of Phehevil hidden behind the thick mist.
The cupboard holds nothing of value.
It's a crucifix of Alll-mer. The statue's expression is that\nof vengeance and rage.
Someone forgot their tea here. It's gone bad long ago...
The wardrobe stores linen and bed sheets.
The shelf has miscellaneous bottles and jars. Seems like\nthis room has been used for rituals of some sort.
The cupboards and shelves got nice and decorated tableware.
There are some cleaning equipment stored here. They are no\nuse for you.
From afar the statue looked convincing and nice, but upon a closer\nlook, it's pretty crude.
A pile of random books. None of them catch your interest.
Looks like someone has violently vomited their guts out here \nand missed the tray.
... That's at least what it looks like.
An empty bucket.
Vials and bottles that seem to contain detergent and washing\nagent. They are no use for you.
Books about varying subjects.
A pile of books. They seem to be in bad shape. Could this\npossibly be a "throw-away pile"?
The walls are covered with paintings. Backdrops, portraits \nand abstact pictures. Melancholy seems to be the only thing\nthey have in common.
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"It has always had its fair share of creeps and religious zealots,\nbut this is a new high. Or new low, however you want to put it."

Charred black matter. Someone actually made this? It does\nlook like food. There seems to be pasta in there somewhere...
With some effort you are able to chip away some of the\n\c[2]Black matter\c[0] with you.
The sink has rusted shut long time ago. But it hasn't stopped\npeople from using it.
The refridgerator is leaking dirty water...
Various different vials and bottles are stored here. They\nall seem grimy and useless to you.
An empty pot.

A bloody toilet hole. The seatings are covered in blood, \nfeces and semen.

\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"You don't get to say a word, but I'll be travelling with you\nfor a while now."
"Oh... Sure I guess."
"You're more than welcome."
"No. There's somewhere I need to be."
"No. I don't want that."

\>\i[80]\}ED-HAIRED MECHANIC\{\<\n"I heard the Eastern Union had a big underground networks around \nPrehevil, but I wasn't expecting this!"

\>\i[80]\}ED-HAIRED MECHANIC\{\<\n"It's close to my line of work, so obviously I keep an eye on articles \nlike that."
\>\i[80]\}ED-HAIRED MECHANIC\{\<\n"I'm not entirely sure what's the purpose of these tunnels exactly, \nbut they must have something to do with the position of this place."
\>\i[80]\}ED-HAIRED MECHANIC\{\<\n"Prehevil, and Bohemia in general is placed in a rather strategic\nposition. It's in the middle of many powerful countries."
\>\i[80]\}ED-HAIRED MECHANIC\{\<\n"What they were building here... I have no idea. But many forces\nwanted to get their hands on this place."

An empty, somewhat rusty bucket.
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Just what the hell were they doing here...?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"There's nothing natural about this place, like nothing at all.\nNothing grows through all this concrete and steel."

\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"I'd even go as far as to say that this place predates the great\nwar quite a bit..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"What could be the purpose of these tunnels... They're are far too\nnarrow for transporting troops... The technology doesn't look like\nit would have obvious militaristic purposes..."

O'saa seems to be talking to himself...
"Did you say something?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"No."
O'saa looks straight at you without flinching his expression a\nbit.
An empty shelf.
The elevator is not responding...
The elevator is busted.
There appears to be a letter and a key in his pocket...
You find \c[2]Soldier's letter\c[0] and the \c[2]Eagle brass key\c[0].
Something falls down from the pockets of \N[16]...
Go up
The elevator is busted. There doesn't seem to be a way back up...
GabText You feel the walls closing in on you...
You switched on the monitor.
Connect Telelectroscope to the Logic
Read the instruction document
There is some text on the monitor in a simplified writing format:\n"The Telelectroscope cannot be connected to the Logic unless all\nthree of the cables are switched ON."
"Connecting one before another does not cause any damage to the\nsystem, but it should not be done without clear orders from the\ndesignated official in charge of the operation."
"Please refer to the operation manual for information on the personnel\nin charge."
Telelectroscope is now set ON.
You don't quite understand what you are looking at... Looks like some \nkinds of information cables?

\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Oh dear... This is incredible."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"This is exactly the same as the one in the other bunker."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Not that it's any less impressive... Still amazes me that tech\nlike this exists."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Let's see... 'Telelectroscope' and 'Logic'..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Yup, it's the same."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Unfortunately I'm still not any wiser. No idea what those terms\nstand for."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"I've never seen anything like this!"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"This is light-years ahead of anything I've seen before."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"What does it say in the monitor... 'Telelectroscope' and 'Logic'..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Never heard of such. Doesn't ring a bell at all."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"That's all you can say about this thing?"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"I'm afraid so. At least for the time being."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"There has to be a proper manual somewhere though."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"If we found that, or any other document about this machinery...\nI'm sure I could piece it together."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Hmm... Well it's a start I guess."

\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Is that all you know woman?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Tsk. I guess that'll have to do for now..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Let's see... Cables... And bolts... And those things..."

\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"This machienery... I'm guessing it's the reason this bunker exists\nin the first place..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Now if we only knew what its purpose was."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"You wouldn't guess it from the outside, but this place is pretty\nsizeable."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"We probably shouldn't mess with this thing if we don't know what\nit does."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Don't be so serious Marcoh."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"What's the worst thing that could happen?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"We are in a mortal danger already. Doesn't get much worse than\nthat."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Just kidding of course."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"You're probably right."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Is it just me or is it hot in here?"

"I can try..."
"I have no idea."
"Why don't you try?"

\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Pity. And here I thought you could be of some use..."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Maybe it's better if you do it."
O'saa seems to be observing his surroundings.
Nothing left in the ammo case.
No reaction. The kicks seem to sink deep, the husk of the\ncreature has become soft and floppy.
It's as if life has escaped the body.
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"The creature's body feels hollow. It feels like a half-empty\nbag of potatos, with the potatos halfway through decomposing."

\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"One second we were at the bunker and now we're here."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Could this happen because of some hallucinogens after all?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"It's the ritual circle... That has to be the portal that got us\nhere."

GabText The streets feels almost too quiet. Even for an abandoned town...
A chained up coffin. The chains seem reinforced and really difficult\nto open up.
A pale tree pushes through the ground. You could climb down if\nyou wanted to.
There is a hole here...
Drop down
It's pretty dark inside the church. It looks like you could drop\ndown to ceiling beams here if you were careful enough...
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Let's see what this miserable place hides up here..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"You can get a decent view of the city from up here..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"You could, if it wasn't for the mist..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"It's really covering everything, isn't it?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"You can almost make out the train from up here... It's not that\nfar. The trip sure felt longer."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"I-is this completely necessary?"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"The roof looks a bit rough. The maintenance's been slacking off."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"The city looks really bad from up here..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"All the roads are jam-packed by automobile wreckage and army\nbarricades."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"This could be a good vantage point without the fog..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"So we're here..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"The church? Seeing how religious Prehevil really is, I'm sure\nthis place is one of the main hubs of the town..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Looks creepy if you ask me."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"The church looks massive. A little intimidating even..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Churches often work as safehavens whenever something bad happens.\nBut this particular church has a somewhat off-putting quality to \nit..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"I wouldn't necessarily take shelter in it myself..."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"A place of worship? Naturally they worship Alll-mer here. How\npredictable and boring."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"The church feels awe-inspiring. Not sure if it's in a good way\nor not..."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"... Do we have to visit the church?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Looks like Prehevil was a warzone just a while before we got \nhere."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I've seen huge riots, a coup d'état or two and none of them left \nbehind this much destruction..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"How could something like this happen to the city without the \nrest of the world knowing about it!?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"The streets are all cluttered... What happened here!?"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"This looks horrible..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"I can't feel but sorry for all the poor souls that had to suffer\nthrough this calamity..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"I wonder if we could take one of these automobiles and just drive\naway..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Leave all this behind..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"The streets look too cluttered for that..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"It looks like the army has barricaded some of the streets as\nwell."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Mm. You're probably right."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Lets keep our eyes open. Maybe we'll find something that gets\nus out of here."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"You saw how the army had created blockades over the railroad \ntracks."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Looks like the same applies to regular roads as well."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I think our best bet would be to just hike through the woods."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"But I'm not sure how safe that would be either.... It looks \nlike this whole area is filled with those... monsters."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"In the forest we'd be out in the open without any real shelter."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Right..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"I wish it was that simple."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"But looks like Bremen army threw a wrench to our plan and blocked\nall the roads leading in and out of Prehevil."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"We'd have to continue walking through the countryside... I'm\nnot sure how safe that exactly would be..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"... Might be worth a shot though."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Maybe if we don't find any other way..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"I'm not too keen on slowly inching away from the city with my\nwheelchair..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"There is a saying where I come from: 'Unni persi i scarpi u \nSignuri'."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Meaning 'Where the lord lost his shoes'. That's what you call\ntowns like this."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"The city seems to be in worse shape than the old town..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"I don't think this is all thanks to the Bremen army..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"This looks far more recent..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Everything alright Levi?"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"You are always so quiet."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"I hope you're not hating us or anything like that?"
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"Huh, what?"
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"Oh no, not at all."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"I'm just not that talkative I guess... Dunno..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Oh, well good!"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Don't worry about that. This whole situation... It's completely\nunderstandable to be at a loss of words."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Just making sure you're alright, that's all."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"You're one of the party, ay?"
Levi gives Abella a faint nod.
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"People of Prehevil... They seem to have reveled in chaos."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"What a horrible thing to say."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"How so?"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"People of this town, they have obviously suffered a great deal!"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Perhaps... Or maybe they embraced the chaos. We do not know."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Chaos itself is not a negative force. Where the chaos leads \ndetermines its alignment."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Sometimes mankind is stuck in a rut and the only thing that can\nbreak the contrived routine is a shock to the system, a pure chaos."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"It's too early to tell where the chaos that fell upon Prehevil\nlead."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Well that's one way to look at things..."
Karin's body...

Looks like she suffered a terrible fate...
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Hoooi! Wait up!"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"I changed my mind!"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Let's check out the church together!"

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Why?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"...It's a long story... I'll save it to some other time. You'll \njust have to take my word for it for now."

\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"I apologise for leaving you like that.\. There were some bumps in\nthe road..."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"But what's important is that you're here. Still alive and strong."
"How could you leave me like that!?"
"Thank you for helping me in the first place."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"I tried to lure those locals elsewhere, to give you a fair chance.\nBut it took me by surprise just how many of them there were..."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"It does of course not excuse my behaviour, but believe me, I did\ntry to get back to you as soon as possible."

"You seem skilled with that bow..."
"What have you been up to?"
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"Yes... I've done my fair share of practice as a youngling."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"Didn't know back then that all the blisters in my hands would be\nworth it in the end."

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I've heard some bullshit justifications like how Bremen Empire had\nto pre-emptively attack just to break up the Eastern Sanctuaries\n-Voroniyan alliance from forming."

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Does this look like self-defence to anyone? Killing people within\nforeign borders."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Not that the newly-formed Eastern Union fared any better. They\nturned out to be nothing but murderous, pillaging, raping and \nlooting neantherdals.

\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"No one's cleaned up any of this..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Does that mean the city has been under this plague since the war \nended?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"How awful... It's always so depressing to see the scars of war so \nvividly."

\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Doesn't look like something that would transfer to us by physical\ncontact, but maybe it's too early to say for sure..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Ack..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"...I didn't even consider the possibility of getting this myself..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"I was talking to few of these poor saps earlier and they claim the\nmoonlight did this."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"So that got me thinking that maybe a bomb of some kind could've \ndetonated nearby and these people mistook the bright explosion as\nthe moonlight..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"I have read about experimental warfare that might fit the bill,\nand the sickness we see in these people could be radioactive fallout\nfrom such explosion..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"But then again... An explosion of that magnitude would surely catch\nattention worldwide."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"So you are considering army meddling!"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Would be silly not to... but you never know. Hey maybe the culprit\nis just what these people say? The moonlight did it."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"And here I thought you were an educated professional."

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Then what am I talking to you for!?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Good question. That's what I was wondering myself too."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I smelled something was off about Bremen occupying Prehevil.\nIt seemed like the whole Bremen campagin focused on getting here."

"How did you get here?"
\>\i[81]\}AMARIE\{\<\n"You don't want me there... If you knew what I've done..."
"It doesn't matter. Let's just get to the train."
"Let's hear it then."

She is just shaking her head in denial.

\>\i[81]\}AMARIE\{\<\n"It's me, Samarie! We've met each other countless times at the\nVatican City! On the long hallways of the Ministry of Darkness!"

A towering figure is standing tall in the shadows...
Slowly the figure approaches you.
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"This thing is supposed to be my father?"
"I doubt she was telling the truth."
"He did melt together with the building..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"No, I'm sure she was telling the truth."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Yes... That sure was bizarre."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"I've never seen it myself before, but I've heard of such magic\npracticed by some old-school dark priests."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"They bind themself to a building, an area or an item in order \nto prolong their existence."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"The fact that he had created that bind already... That means he \nmust have been dead already."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Only living through this church..."
"I'm sorry for your loss..."
"I can't even imagine how you feel..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"No need to."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"I don't feel a thing for him."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"No... I can see the resemblance. This is him."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"It's clearly his ugly face."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"I never liked the bastard."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"This means he must've been struggling for a good while."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Serves him right."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"He had this coming for a looonng time."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"I've never known a more vile and despicable person."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Almost comically angry at everyone and everything."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Just avoiding the obvious all his life. If no one likes you,\nyou keep insisting everyone else is wrong."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"You treat others like trash and wonder why you end up alone."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"What a sad case."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Hopefully his enslavement continues forever. He can be one with\nhis dear little parish."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Hopefully his enslavement continues in afterlife..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Hopefully the gods make sure he knows just how insignificant his\nwhole existence ended up being..."

\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"He's but a helpless pulsating pillar of flesh now......"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"A fitting end for such a spineless piece of shit......."
This thing is supposedly your father...
You've never seen it yourself before, but you've heard of such \nmagic practiced by dark priests of the olden times.
They would bind themself to a building, an area or an item in \norder to prolong their existence.
The fact that he had created that bind already... That means he \nmust have been dead already.
Only living through this church...
It does have a striking resemblance to him, so it must be true.
A wave of emotions rushes through you.
You feel sadness...
Nostalgia...
Pity...
Frustration...
Disbelief...
Anger...
Disgust...
Hatred...
Arrogance...
Guilt.

\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"The skin has gone through some kind of a metamorphosis. It's very\nthick and sturdy. Almost gives her an armor of sorts..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"The head... It's her face, only peeled open. Charming."
Her body has gone through some kind of a metamorphosis. The skin\nfeels thick and sturdy. It's almost armor-like.
Her head has been peeled open. The skin is stretched on the rim\nthat goes around her head.
She has nothing of value.
The skin is too thick for your teeth to sink in.
The skin is too thick for you to penetrate it.
You took the \c[2]Dysmorphia head\c[0] as a trophy!
A formless pillar of human flesh...
A seemingly bottmless pit. A smell of rot is eminating from\nthe depths...
A pillar of clay...
Mold it
You made an idol of yourself.

\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"How do you fight back against something you cannot understand?"
The gate is locked with a simple lock...
There is a person, or being buried under the chains.
The chains have some kinds of sigils etched all over them...
Use the \c[2]Rusty key\c[0]
Try to open the chains
The chains won't budge.
They seem to be kept in place by a rusty padlock that has similar\nsigils carved into it as the chains have.
The being is gone...
All that is left are the chains and the padlock.
You pick up the \c[2]Heart-shaped lock\c[0]!
Only the chains remain.

\>\i[76]\}AN IN BLACK\{\<\n"As one, the 'ascended one' became two - That was when humanity\nfinally reached the heights it had always strived for."

\>\i[76]\}AN IN BLACK\{\<\n"If the other one had been dug deep within Alll-mer's \nsub-consciousness, it had to be sent back just as deep so it wouldn't\nobstruct the newfound order."

The flickering light of the bonfire soothes you despite the\nhorrors waiting you outside...
It's too dark down there. You cannot see anything but darkness.
You cannot hear or see anything down there.

A wall of severed heads. The heads seem to be in varying\nstates of rot.
The earliest heads look like several weeks old, while the\nmost recent ones seem to be freshly cut.
Dirty dishes and leftovers. Considering the place, you're not\nentirely sure what's the origin of fleshy meat...
A sealed metal crate left here to gather rust.
The person is barely alive. You can already hear death rattle\ncoming from him...
Finish him

"I don't need new acquaintances."

\i[325] Prehevil, Old Town\n\i[326] Maiden Woods
This is a big crate. You can really open it without better\ntools...
A bloody bowl. The blood is all dried up.
A bloody bowl.
There is someone's diary on the floor.
"I feel the rope tightening around my neck with each passing day.\nThe city has always been narrow-minded and bigoted. If you didn't \nfollow the doctrine to a t, you'd be persecuted to no end."
"The priests don't encourage this behiour with words, but they don't\nhave to. The centuries of inbreeding and inward looking has created \nan atmosphere where there is no room for deviation, let alone \ncriticism."
"The mob mentality takes over the town at regular intervals and\nthe gallows become familiar to every nonconformist."
"I've seen this happen time and time again, yet for some reason\nI never imagined becoming the next in line to go."
"So here we are now. I saw the signs. I'll prepare for my leave.\nIn the meantime I take temporary shelter at these outskirts."
"The moon is awfully high tonight. I hear noises echo from the\nheart of the city... The mob gathered around that hollow tower..."
"The high priest will have his speech there... I fear that I\nlingered for too long... I should've left the city years ago \nalready."
You take the \c[2]Film reel\c[0].
Looks like someone has gathered all of the possession here.
You find nothing useful.
There is a portrait of a young man on the table. The person has his\nface scrather over.

\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"I'm pretty sure this hatch hasn't been used by the locals."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"I definitely didn't know this existed here..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"It's weird. You'd think you'd know your own hometown after 18\nyears, but ever since we got here on that train I've discovered\na new side of Prehevil."

\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"See the red carpet? That's supposedly a traditional carpet design\nused by the noblemen of Bohemia."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"A completely useless tidbit, I know, but I decided to share it\nanyway."

You had a massive orgasm and passed out.
There's a toolbox left here.
The toolbox is empty.
A pile of metal crates that are sealed shut.
Your head hurts. Your body feels a little slow as it's recovering\nfrom paralysis...
You find a chain tied to your ankle...
There an electric panel here... You don't really know what to do \nwith it.
The crate is sealed shut.
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"A hidden bunker... This got me curious."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I was thinking that these tunnels could be a possible mission silo,\nor a construct for some other kind of weapon..."

\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"I'm sorry if I'm just slowing you down..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Another tunnel? There's something more to these things I'm sure."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"These tunnels go surprisingly far. It's almost as if there is a\nwhole network of these things underground."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Yep. This bunker definitely wasn't here before."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"It's crazy to think that all this exists under Prehevil..."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"I would've known if something like this was being made under our\nfeet when I was a kid."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"I wonder... How new are these tunnels really?"

The sarcofagus looks hundreds of years old. It must be close to\nas old as this church.
The stone slab cover doesn't seem to budge. Either it's heavier than\nwhat it looks like or there is a mechanism keeping it in place.

The body of the crimson father disappeared upon its defeat.\nThere is only an empty shell left behind. The shell looks fairly\ntypical snail shell to you. But you're not an expert of snails\nthough, so it's not 100% accurate information.

A pool of blood... The blood looks relatively fresh...
You can see the silhouette of your reflection in the blood. It\ndistorts beyond recognition.
A bucket full of grime.
Something's been written on the book...
"New gods?"
"What do you think happens if a monkey is given the power of a \nhigher being? All it knows is to rape and devour everything on \nits path, just to survive."
There is writing of blood here...
"They came from the pools of blood."
"Oh yes I can read blood. I was born from it."
"The bloodshed attracts them."
There's a ritual circle carved here. If you had something to\ndraw with, you could actually use it.

There's something hidden here in the darkness...
The hallway has been blocked by all this random junk.
An empty suitcase.

The view is almost straight through the windows of the \nneighbour. The residents of these buildings don't care much \nfor the privacy...
A painting of a tranquil landscape. It's strange to see such\npeaceful scenery in the middle of all this chaos.
A painting of a gaunt figure. The picture depicts a young\nmale with striking cheekbones.
Dirty laundry. The stains are there for good. No amount of\nscrubbing will clean these plates.
This must be the television room...
The entire room is focused on this television set.
Too bad it's useless because of the lack of electricity...

\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"Out of necessity - One's gotta get their money from somewhere,\nI got back into what I used to do as a lad with my parents, that's \ncooking meals at their tavern."
\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"Turns out, I had a knack for that stuff. The tavern got famous.\nThey even wrote an article about the place on the local paper."

These books are straight on erotica. Just one glimpse at the\ncovers makes that perfectly clear.
The table has the newest additions to the book store. Many of\nthe books are drama and fiction written in either Bremen or\nRondon.

Two brothers who established a fishing route on a particularly\ndangerous waters finally pushed their luck too far and were\ncaught in a massive whirlwind.

\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"People blamed all the possible powers above them. The kings and\nsultans of the time, the so-called 'new gods', the gods of old...\nEveryone but themselves."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"Not that different from the times we live in as we speak..."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"It was close to a breaking point for the entire civilized world,\nit would have been just that if it wasn't for the glimmer of hope\nat the end of the tunnel..."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"There was a prophecy about a man with golden locks that would\nshepherd the mankind out of the darkness."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"It just happened so, that a man with similar features was rising\nup in fame in central Europa."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"The man promised a just world, one where the corrupted royalty\nand the old world order would come crumbling down. The ones who\nheld too tight to the old world would feel it in their skin."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"But the hierarchy of the old world would not be shaken with mere \nwords. The man had to find strength that would outmatch the vast\narmies of the kings and sultans of the old kingdoms..."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"That kind of strength is not easy to come by. So he did anything \nand everything it took to get that very power."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"He made a lot of villainous moves to pursuit his agenda. One could\nsay he came close to the same evil he promised to crush."

\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"Ultimately the man did get strength he so yearned, but at what \ncost?"
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"In his pursuit, he fed the darkness of the world, enough so that \na new deity was born. The God of Fear and Hunger."

\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"People would fall for this new deity in masses. Most likely because \nshe was a creation of their own. A manifestation of their own misery."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"Misery and hardship often create kinship. At the very least the \ngod of fear and hunger didn't represent the old world order, that's\nwhat mattered the most."

\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"The man did re-emerge from the darkness, but by then the world had\nalready found a new saviour from the deity."
\>\i[64]\}UGUST\{\<\n"As his pursuits turned out to be meaningless, he slowly started \nto spiral into madness. His frustrations would slowly show themselves\nin rising hostility and violence."

A glass of Old Vinland whiskey. Even before sipping from the finely decorated\nglass, the aroma of the old wooden barrels that 
An old-fashioned.

A cosmopolitan.
A glass of milk.
You finish the drink.
Daan looks dead. He has foam coming from his mouth...
A glass of Old Vinland whiskey. Even before sipping \nfrom the finely decorated glass, the rich and deep \naroma fills your nostrils. You wait for a brief second \nbefore taking the first sip.
The whiskey gives a small burning sensation on its way \ndown, but still you savour the taste for as long as it \nlingers on the tip of your tongue.
A deep warmth fills your insides long after the glass \nis empty.
You rock the ice around the glass for a few times. \nThe old fashioned settles down and you catch its \nscent that is a mix of both sweet and musky.
You taste the drink briefly to check out the exact \nratio of its ingredients...
The whiskey (which seems to be on the more expensive \nside) is clearly the dominating flavour, but the \nsugar and the water help the drink roll off your \ntongue more easily.
You are pleased to notice that the herbal taste of \nthe Angostura only hints with its presence afterwards, \nnever trying to rival the key ingredients.
It soon becomes evident that this drink is perfectly\nmixed old fashioned. It has all the best qualities of\na good whiskey but it's casual enough for you to drink\nit like a sailor.
You take a sip from the delicate glass, covered in \nslight frost. The ice cold drink creates a refreshing \ninitial impression as the bitterness of the gin kicks\nyou with its liquor taste.
Quickly vermouth in the drink takes over however\nas its sweetness becomes more dominant in the \naftertaste.
The drink is doing a fine balancing act between being\na 'dry martini' and 'wet martini'. Just a little bit\nmore vermouth and you couldn't call the drink 'dry'\nanymore with good conscience.
Not that it's a complaint. The drink really is quite\nremarkable, wet or dry.
On your second sip you notice some of the finer \nnuances of the drink. The mild aftertaste of saline\nfrom the olives... And is that lemon zest you taste?
Before you know it, the small glass is empty and all\nyou have left of the drink are the warm memories.
The blend of the cocktail looks immaculate. You \nhave no doubts that the taste will be just as good \nas you raise the delicate glass on your lips...
The freshly squeezed lime presents the dominating\nsour flavour but it is balanced masterfully with\nthe sweetness that comes from the triple sec. The\nliquor gives the drink sweet orange flavour.
The slight hint of cranberry juice in the background\nkeeps your taste buds guessing as the vodka blends\neverything together by diluting the most powerful\nflavours.
The taste is fruity, refreshing and a perfect blend\nof sweet and sour. After few more sips you'd say\nthat the orange-flavoured triple sec is the unsung\nhero of the cocktail.
The citrus punch really takes the drink to another\nlevel. The cosmo truly is a light drink. Dangerously\nso.
You can only tell there was a large amount of vodka \nin the drink from the slight fuzz in your head as\nyou finish the drink.
You drink the milk. It's...\. well, it's just milk. \nIt doesn't exactly inspire the poet inside you.

\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Don't blame me if your theory got gaping holes in it."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"The effects of radiation poisoning show very quickly and we'd all\nbe out of the game at this point if your theory was bulletproof."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"On the other hand the burns and mutations in case of nuclear \nradiation are products of long term exposure to milder radiation."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"I was checking up on the locals at the old town and some of the\npeople went through rapid changes in a matter of hours."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"The personal traits seem to affect the pace of the mutation greatly\ntoo. That doesn't sound like any kind of radiation I'm familiar of."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I didn't ask you a goddamn thing."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Just ignore him."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"The man is full of it. He likes to portray himself as a doctor,\nbut he actually doesn't have an education to speak of."

\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Are you kidding me?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"The whole town is abandoned, if I find a bottle of vodka from a\ntrash can, it's okay, but when I want a drink in a bar it's a no?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Yup, you got it right."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"I do have some milk if you want it?"

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"You don't deserve this, but food?"

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Fine."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Hope you rot here."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Hey, you!"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Are you still surviving here?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Good. We might still need you alive, as a meat shield or something."
Marina has a grim expression on her face.
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Must be your lucky day then. That's exactly why I came here."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"You should've thought about that before you did what you did..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"I take that as a 'yes'."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"I got this piece of bread for you that might or might not be\nseasoned with my spit."

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Looks like this place hasn't been defiled yet."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Emphasis on that 'yet'."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"What a cool little club!"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Almost makes you forget everything that's going on outside."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"This club reminds me that there is a normal world out there too."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Gives me hope."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"I get it. We have places to be. I can't be bartending here all\nday."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"I haven't been to places like this before... You must think I'm\nthe biggest geek around."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"This place... It's one of the few positive memories I have of\nthis town..."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"I snuck here occasionally. The staff were happy give me a brief\nrespite from the life at the orphanage..."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Clubs like these are one of the few good things the so-called\n'western world' has produced."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Oh? Colour me surprised. I didn't take you for a club-going jive\nbomber."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"I can admit as much."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"A real ducky shincracker we got here."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"It's a good way to clear one's mind."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"This place would be easy to defend. There is only one clear entry\npoint."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"And since it's underground, any noise we make wouldn't reach\nthe street level."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Only one entry point means we got only one escape point too."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"True. But it also works as a bottle neck. Only one hostile could\ncome through at any given time."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Sounds like a disaster in making to me."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I don't like the idea. But if everyone else is on board..."
\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"Oh hey you!"
\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"I decided to bring my road kitchen to PRHVL Bop too!"
\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"One night only!"
"How do you like the club?"
\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"I like it!"
\>\i[68]\}ENRYK\{\<\n"I once worked as a bartender as a youngling, the place wasn't too\ndifferent from this place."

\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"Hello! I made it here in one piece!"
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"Good afternoon."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"This really is a lovely place. Almost feels like the last safe\nhaven in the entire world."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"A part of me doesn't want to leave this warm bird nest... Knowing\nwhat's waiting me outside..."
"You can stay here, I'll try to make sense of what's outside."
"We can't just shove our heads to sand..."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"You are a brave soul."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"Are you sure you do not possess a soul of a samurai?"
"What does 'samurai' mean?"
"Do you really think so?"
"This is getting too weird."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"It means 'Edoan warrior'."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"Hai."
A great pride fills you from the inside. It feels like you are\nfinally being acknowledged for what and who you really are.
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"I'm sorry if I have embarrassed you. It wasn't my intention."
\>\i[82]\}ANAKA\{\<\n"True words. I didn't mean my words to come off as cowardly."

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Let me see!"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"B-but... I hid it here. I swear I did!"

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Good."

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Fair enough I guess..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"But I didn't make up that journal. It definitely existed."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I guess I'll have to prove myself some other way..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Fine. Whatever. I know the truth, that's all that matters."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I'm out of this dump."

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I'd appreciate if you said anything."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Whatever. I know the truth, that's all that matters."
She's dead.
A partly charred body. There seems to be something hanging on his\nneck...
You find a \c[2]Soul devour necklace\c[0]!
The body has gone through intense physical trauma. Looks like he\nsuffered from severe burns.
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"That is one tall statue!"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"A little intimidating, if I'm perfectly honest..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"The statue looks familiar... Is it an older god?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Why is it left in the darkness like this?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"It's the statue of Alll-mer. At least one depiction of the god."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"There used to be a large crack going through its forehead all the\nway to the chest, but looks like it has been fixed since I last\nsaw it..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Pretty impressive sight..."
Levi is just staring at the giant statue with his mouth open.
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"I'm guessing you've never seen this before?"
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"No, never seen it..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"This altar was closed from the public back in the day. I'm not \nsure why."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"The statue is supposed to depict Alll-mer?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"What a bastardized version of him."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Yes, yes, the statue is impressive, but you're ignoring the\nelephant in the room - the sacrificial altar!"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"What the hell is going on in this town!?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"What is this...? A huge sacrificial altar?"
You see multiple eyes glowing in the darkness above...
\>\i[80]\}ANCID THE SERGAL\{\<\n"You're not the one I'm after! Who are you!?"
\>\i[80]\}ANCID THE SERGAL\{\<\n"I see, I see. You're one those idiots."

\>\i[80]\}ANCID THE SERGAL\{\<\n"Doppelgängers replacing missing folk, old deities rising up from\ntheir graves, space and time tearing up..."
\>\i[80]\}ANCID THE SERGAL\{\<\n"The forces are desperately trying to fix the balance because of\nyou knuckleheads!"

You picked up the \c[2]Sergal spear\c[0] from the severed hand of\nthe sergal.
The doors are locked from the other side...
The books are growing together because of the white crust that is\ncovering this entire building.
All the spare keys to the apartments appear to be here...
Among them you find the \c[2]Master key\c[0]!
GabText Quiet... All the sounds from outside are muffled by the thick walls.
A toolbox with random tools for everyday apartment maintenance.
A dirty bucket used for cleaning. The mop is sealed inside the bucket.\nYou cannot get it out.
A dirty bucket used for cleaning.
A bucket that's been sealed shut. You can't quite tell what the\nbucket contains.
The boxes are used to store folders and papers, but everthing is\ncovered in the same white crust so you cannot be 100% certain on\nthe contents.
The boxes are used to store cleaning products, but everthing is\ncovered in the same white crust so you cannot be 100% certain on\nthe contents.
The refridgerator is sealed shut because of the white crust that\nseems to be covering everything in this building.
The oven is sealed shut because of the white crust that seems to\nbe covering everything in this building.
The faucet doesn't budge. It's stuck no matter how hard you try to\nwring it.
The cupboards only contain regular household items. Nothing of\ninterest.
The window is sealed shut by the white crust that is covering\nseemingly everything in this building.
The television screen is filled with white noise once again.
You recognize yourself from the TV screen, yet you don't ever\nremember doing a broadcast like this in your life.
You are certain that you've never even visited this city before,\nso how can there be footage of you commentating a murder?
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"W-what is this...?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"This footage... That's me...?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"It can't be..."
"What's wrong?"
"What's the big deal?"
"I didn't see anything odd in there."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"This gives me some serious creeps..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"What if I told that I've never done a broadcast like that?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Not only that, I've never even been to Prehevil before. There\nis no way this footage should exist."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"What's the big deal!?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"What if I told that I've never done a broadcast like that!"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Hell, I've never even been to Prehevil before!"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"No, you don't get it."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I've never done a broadcast like that!"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Yet there I am... talking about a case I have no clue about."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"This makes no sense. Am I losing my mind here?"
"Maybe you've forgotten this?"
"Maybe it's a doppelgänger?"
"Nothing in this place makes sense."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Just how do you forget things like that?!"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I'm sure about this..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"She even got my 'commentator' voice. My way of speaking when in\nfront of a camera."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Let's just finish our business here and get out. The sooner the\nbetter."
Karin looks clearly distressed by this incident.
Watch television?
You can only see white noise...
No wait, there are shapes forming in the chaos...
Mail boxes for the apartment residents. They're covered with some\nkind of white crust that prevents their use.
Most of the text in the book is illegible but there is a one \npassage that you can make sense of...
"Only when I'm alone in here, during the late hours. Only then I \nnotice the true nature of these hallways. The cracked floor tiles,\ndecrepit toilets, the moldy planks that rise up to the endless \nheights."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"What's wrong with this place...?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"...Anyone home...?"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"It's so quiet here."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Like the whole house is in a deep sleep..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"This building... Something feels very off about this place..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"What is this mold...?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"It's covering everything..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"I'm not sure if it's actually mold..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"The texture is unlike anything I've seen..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Rubbery and crusty at the same time."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Yes..."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"This place... Do you feel dizzy too?"
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"It's not natural for people to live in closed spaces like these."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Depends on the rent really..."
Marcoh is looking grim for some reason.
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"What's the matter Marcoh?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Nothing."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"You look so grim?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"I don't really like closed places..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"You've got a claustrophobia?"
Looks like the boiler hasn't seen use in a good while.
The washing machine started shaking the moment you got out. You can't\nclimb back in as it is...
There is a washing machine standing here.
The glass screen is too filthy for you to see inside...
The insides are bloody and disgusting.
Upon further investigation you notice that the washing machine hole\nturns into a tunnel. You can see faint light out there in a short\ndistance.
Crawl in
Empty.
The door is sealed shut by some sort of mold...
GabText Something reeks down here...
Moldy crates.
Moldy boxes.
The doorway is completely blocked by the boxes.
A sink that is covered with white crust from top to bottom.
The washing machine started shaking violently the moment you got out. \nYou can't climb back in as it is...
The washing machine is shaking violently. There is a padlock with\na mechanical 4-digit code keeping the lid closed.
Set a password
Force the washing machine open
The glass window is dirty with murky liquids foaming inside.
You don't see any laundry inside though. Occasional thump sounds\nsuggest that there are some objects inside.
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Ah. There must be additional safety locks inside. I can't seem\nto get this thing open..."
The door doesn't open. It must have additional safety locks inside.
You could use the \c[2]Master key\c[0] here?
The plant is covered with the white crust, similar to pretty much\neverything else in this apartment.
The door is sealed shut because of the mold-like growth...
The plant is covered in the white crust. It feel very delicate and\ndry because of that. It crumbles to dust if you even touch it gently.

The plants are covered in the white crust. They feel very delicate\nand dry because of that. They crumble to dust if you even touch them.
The wardrobe contains random clothing, all covered in white crust\nmaking them pretty much useless...
The matress seems to have been in heavy use in the past. Now it\nis laid to a white rest similar to the entire building.
There is a book on the floor with some erratic writing in it.
You find the \c[2]Diary of a madman\c[0].
There is a sigil of the Sulfur god on the floor.
You hear voices echoing from the beheaded wizard...\n\c[7]"Sulfur god...? Now that's something I wasn't expecting."\c[0]
"What do you know about the sulfur god?"
"Should we be worried?"
You hear voices echoing from the beheaded wizard...\n\c[7]"Not much. Probably the same as you at this point."\c[0]

The hulking thing seems to have gone through a large-scale transformation.\nThere are signs in its anatomy that this thing once was a human.
Its skin has become scorched and is hard to puncture, its arms\nhave gained mass and they now look more like bags of potatos, and\nfinally its head seems to have transformed in a form that emphasizes \nmouth and tongue.
There is no known medical ailment that could cause something this\nbig.

You took the \c[2]Neighbour head\c[0] as a trophy!
It's so quiet and peaceful. You fall asleep immediately.
You could sleep here forever. Just forget the outside world and stay\nin bed.
You became a permanent part of the sleeping house.
There is a moldy bed here... You could sleep and rest if you wanted\nto, although every alarm bell is ringing in your head when it comes\nto this apartment.
There is a portrait of a young man on the table. The person has his\nface scrathed over.
The lamp doesn't work. Or if it does, the light doesn't come through\nthe white crust, so it's all the same.
The rotten floorboards gave in to the weight of the statue.\nNow there is a gaping hole to the darkness here...
It's dark down there. But by the looks of the rough shapes you can\nsee, it should just be a similar apartment to this.
A horsehead statue stands proudly here. The statue doesn't seem too\nheavy. You could push it pretty easily...
Push it
The door is locked with a simple lock. There is handwriting on the \ndoor that says "Please do not disturb."
There is a moldy bed here... You could sleep and rest if you wanted\nto, although every alarm bell is ringing in your head when it comes\nto this apartment, not to mention the dolls...
Rest with the dolls
GabText It's so quiet. No one could probably hear your scream from here...
Tanaka has a blank expression on his face. He doesn't seem to react\nto any of your moves...
The telescope seems to be carefully positioned here, but you cannot\ntell where it points at because the window is covered in white crust.
Mold has filled the book pages. You can't make any sense of it.

The staircase is blocked...
Karin unlocked the gate with her lockpicking skills.
A dirty bucket with dried murky mucus in the bottom.
It smells greasy and disgusting.
There is only a thin layer of dust filling the shelves.
There is a hole here. You could jump down if you wanted to.
It's dark down there. You can see a sigil of some kind shining\nfaintly in the darkness.
It's dark down there. You can't see anything else.

You feel nothing.
This globe is a little outdated. The Second Great War demolished\nmany country borders as well as gave a new identy to some nations.
The shelves are stacked with utility items and miscellaneous school \nsupplies.
GabText Dust specks float quietly in the air. The air is foreboding.
There're only random school papers here. Nothing useful.
GabText The fallen cherub is shot down!
The door seems to be locked from the other side.
There are books about various different subjects on the table.
Between the books you find a note that says:\n"Someone stole the headmaster's ring. It must be found. Search\nthe lockers and beds. Strip search the children if you have to."
The bulletin board has information about upcoming school events.\nAll of the events date back over one month.
A rusty bucket. There's still some dirty water in the bottom.
A bucket left here to gather rust.
The boxes have miscellaneous school supplies and papers in them.
The cabinets contain documents of all the students and orphans\nthat take residence here.
From a quick glance you can tell that the documents contain \nvery intrusive information. It appears that none of the \nchildren have any privacy under this roof.
Someone's teeth are at the bottom of the bucket. They appear\npretty small. They must be from one of the children living\nunder this roof.

The developing body of this child-like creature has gone through \nsevere malformations. Many anatomical points suggest that this\ncreature once was a human child.
The prolonged neck and claws are the biggest cases of curiosity,\nbut the skin also looks like it was burned or boiled at some point\nin time. The skin feels dry and brittle.
The creature's frame isn't very sturdy, it's weak against \npiercing physical attacks as well as otherwordly powers and fire.

"Alll-mer - The Ascended One is a great example on how different\nthese perspectives can really be when examining them through the \nlens of different cultures."
"In Europa Alll-mer is often depicted as a male with caucasian facial\nfeatures, a bald head and a muscular body."
"In the Eastern Sanctuaries Alll-mer is often described according \nto his earlier depictions when he was still just a mortal."
"In these images he is often thinner than his western counterpart\nand sports a longer hair, closer to how he was described before \nascending and losing all his bodily hair."
"Naturally his facial features often depict him as a native to\nEastern Sanctuaries too."
"The western depictions highlight his godly stature, whereas in\nthe Eastern Sanctuaries he is more humanized."

There is text detailing the origin of the eastern armor...
"A traditional body armor that was typically worn by the warrior\nclass of Yansa Aryuaban. The cuirass consists individual leather\nand/or iron scales that are connected to each other with leather\nor silk lace depending on the era."
"The armor is a great example of the two cultures of Edo and \nEastern Sanctuaries melting together."
"During the 8th century Eastern Sanctuaries led multiple campaigns\nagainst the Kingdom of Edo, but each proved out to be fruitless \nendeavours."
"The sultan of the Eastern Sanctuaries, Nas'hrah the Great did have\ncertain respect for his adversary and acknowledged the warring arts\nof Edo that were highly developed in the isolation of an island \nnation."
"Since he was unable to make the warring arts his own by \nconquering the kingdom and forcing it under his rule, \nhe instead formed a brand new country inside the borders of \nEastern Sanctuaries."
"He appointed the high status war prisoners from Edo as the\ncentral figures of this new country and ordered them to mimic\nthe ways of Edo as closely as possible and breed a warrior class\nfor the eternal kingdom that was Eastern Sanctuaries."
"This didn't happen over night but rather took hundreds of years,\nbut ultimately Eastern Sanctuaries did get what Nas'hrah wanted -\nThe warrior class 'Jizamurai' was born in the Yansa Aryuaban."

"The stone carving illustrates a meeting between an extraterrestial\nolder god and the people of Songhai empire."
"Mythological figure known as Betel the Enlightened One. The famed\nNew God who formed the Grand Libraries in the city of the gods\nwhere every one of his successors would gather their knowledge and\nfill the library shelves with books from all forms of expertise."

\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"Are they doing this... voluntarily?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Looks like that, right?"
The yellow mage looks weirdly nonchallant and not disturbed by the\nscreams. He barely even glances at the people hanging on the hooks.
Marcoh is left speechless.
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"It's rare that something would leave me this speechless..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Can we just leave this place already?"
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"This is horrible."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Are those screams of agony... or pleasure...?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"I-I can't take this much longer... The screams..."
Levi is cautiously looking up to the people hanging on the hooks.
The yellow mage looks weirdly nonchallant and not disturbed by the\nscreams.
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"The screaming... It's getting louder..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Dear god... Sounds horrible..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Someone has to be in agony! We have to help them!"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"W-what is this... Who... or what...?"
The dried man is holding something tightly in his fist...
You find a \c[2]Leechmonger ring\c[0]!
The dried man looks dead. He's not breathing and looks almost\nmummified for whatever reason.
GabText Vertigo distorts the view of the lower rooms. You feel dizzy.
Levi is looking behind nervously.
You take the \c[2]Chainmail dress\c[0]!
GabText The stores offer at least some sense of normalcy that once was.
There's blood everywhere...
GabText A dull odor lingers the hallways...
GabText Despite being a place for children, you sense no joy.
The paintings seem to depict the past teachers and headmasters\nthat worked in the building.
Everyone has the same stoic and cold expression on their face.
The books show detailed schedules of everyone living in the\norphanage.
Looks like there's not much free time for the kids living here...
You could use the \c[2]Headmaster's key\c[0] here?
There are dried blood stains here.
There's a meat dish on the table. From the looks of it, it's been\nhere for a long while. It has gone bad.
You take some \c[2]Rotten meat\c[0].
Dirty dishes are scattered everywhere.
The pot only has grimy stains covering its insides.
An empty ceramic bottle.
The plates are swarming with maggots eating the leftovers.
The refridgerator is in filthy condition. The condition clearly\npredates the catastrophic event that is currently at play.
Among the filthy things you find a \c[2]White vial\c[0]!
There are only standard kitchenware in the cupboards.
There's nothing in the oven. A faint smell of burnt meat does\neminate from the inside though.
It appears that someone has been spitting inside the bucket.
The radiator feels cold.
The trash bucket has few torn papers inside. Nothing of interest.
The sink is filthy with dark red stains. Is it dried blood?
Someone hasn't flushed the toilet...
A dirty toilet. At this point you didn't even expect anything\nless.
A broken mirror equals bad luck to whoever broke it. You\nwonder if that person ended up living up to that saying.\nProbably.
A medium dirty sink.
A bathtub. Some dark hair is entangled around the plughole.
A repulsive smell eminates from the plughole.
An empty iron bucket.
The cabinets contain documents of random Prehevilian people. \nApparently the orphanage has kept record of their previous \norphans even after they leave the place.
There are rusty iron chains here. They covered with similar \nstains that are found on the floor.
A lone wheelchair is left here.
There's a \c[2]Talking board\c[0] on the table...
You won the game of hangman. No one was hanged today.
No need to play it anymore.
You lost the game of hangman. The figure met its fate on the\nhanging tree.
You won the game of hangman! No one was hanged today!
You lost the game of hangman.
The figure met its fate on the hanging tree.
Take the \c[2]Talking board\c[0] and leave
You take the \c[2]Talking board\c[0]!
Take the \c[2]Talking board\c[0]
Opening the school desk revealed \c[2]Talking board instructions\c[0] \nas well!
It's a game of hangman. If you don't guess the right letters that\nmake up the keyword, the stick figure will meet its end on the\nhanging tree.
You wonder where such macabre children's play originates from.
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Is it... crying?"
\>\i[85]\}EEPING SCOPE\{\<\n"..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"It's all alone. So no wonder."
"It's a monster, no need for sympathy."
"Was he once a human?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"I've seen more monstrous people."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"He's not doing anything bad at the moment, so why hurt him?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"His torso would suggest as much..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Something very strange is happening to the people of this city."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Maybe it's the other way around? What if he was a monster first\nand now he is slowly turning into human?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"That's just stupid."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Oh...?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"If you were a monster, wouldn't you want to be more human?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"There's no logic in that. Obviously it's the townsfolk that are \nturning into these things. Otherwise we'd see more of these 'monsters\nin human clothing' around."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"You do have a point."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Who knows really?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Maybe it's the other way around? What if he was something else\nfirst and he is slowly turning into more human?"
The weeping scope is weeping.
The weeping scope gives you no answer.
The bed looks comfy and in tip-top shape...
You hear stumbling footsteps nearing you...
The bed is full of rubbish.
This room is too open. It doesn't feel safe to rest here.
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Some school lessons ring true, no matter the age."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"If someone bullies you in school, you answer with extreme force. \nThrow a chair at them. Kick their teeth in.\. That'll stop the \nbullying."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"We wouldn't even have this shitshow called 'The Great War' if the\nbullies had their teeth kicked in when it mattered the most!"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Another lesson that rings true to this day - No one liked this\none teacher in our class. So one day we all skipped the class,\nwhat could he have done? Flunk everyone?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I don't think so. That would only make himself look bad."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Again, we wouldn't have this shitshow if everyone from in the\narmies just went home and stopped listening to their superiors."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"What are the old men at the top gonna do!? Fight the wars \nthemselves?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n*Pft* "I wish, would have few lunatics less in this world."
\N[22] tilts his head sideways as you try to communicate\nwith him...
There are only random school related documents here.
A timetable for the upcoming semester. Nothing too out of ordinary.\nMaybe just one or two religious lessons too many...
An empty trash bin.
A stained table...
It's an empty milk bottle.
This pipe feel cold.
This pipe feel hot.
GabText The inner yard is overgrown with weeds of different kinds.
The otherwordly force that was keeping the door shut... It's gone\nnow...
An otherwordly force seems to keep the door stuck...
You could use \c[2]Purifying talisman\c[0] here?
\>\i[144]\}OCKETCAT\{\<\n"So you've decided to partake in that degenerate festivity?"
\>\i[144]\}OCKETCAT\{\<\n"As you wish master."
A lone hanging platform... What is it doing here?
He has been hanged...
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"Why is there a hanging platform in a schoolyard!?"
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"They say the orphanage used to be a courthouse back in the day..."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"It's supposed to be a leftover from those times."
\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"But no one really believed that..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Oh right!"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"I remember seeing some old photographs of the courthouse and \nthe hanging took place in front of the building..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"So that makes no sense really..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"If I remember correctly, there used to be a courthouse here or \nsomething before the orphanage..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Although I remember seeing some old photographs of the courthouse\nand the hanging took place in front of the building..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"A hanging platform... In the schoolyard?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Of course there is one. Wouldn't expect anything less from this\nhellbent town..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"W-why... Why is there a hanging tree here?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Was this hanging tree ever used?"

\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"I was relieved to get some fresh air... But..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"The gallows kind of ruin the moment of respite..."
Marcoh is lost in his thoughts while looking intensely at the\ngallows. 
You read his mind...\n\c[1]"Something always comes to remind me of what I've done. There's \nno escaping it, is there?"\c[0]
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Don't look too intesely, just so you don't get any ideas."

There is a mysterious lamp on the table.
Rub it
\..\..\..\..\..\..
You rubbed the lamp real good. It's polished now.
Sounds like there is something inside the lamp...
Try to shake the lamp
Let it be
Upon turning and shaking the lamp a \c[2]Soul stone\c[0] rolled out.
The lamp has faint ornament letters. You cannot recognize the \nlanguage, but it reminds you of Eastern Sanctuaries.
The shelves are full of supposed occult items. Many of them look\nfraud to you though.
Some kind of alchemic furnace. Something has been burned here\nrecently. The smell is that of old exotic spices.
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"What kind of nonsense are they selling here?"
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Oh this place! I love it."

\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Or that?"

GabText A smell of old spices and incense fills the dusty air.

You take the \c[2]Hunger effigy\c[0]!
The barrel contains gore and some white substance. It reeks terrible!
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"One second we were at the school and now we're here."

It's too steep to climb up but you could jump down from here with\nease though...

What's this? There is something buried under the dirt...

Yell for help

The beast seems to have the physique of a normal wolf, only ten\ntimes bigger, has three eyes, possibly four and a mouth full of\nsharp teeth.
There doesn't appear to be any signs of mutation. Could this beast\nhave grown to this size on its own, naturally?
The sword - if you can even call it that - on its back is a \ncurious thing. It looks almost organic... Like it's alive?

\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"There's a rack full of rifles here... They're similar to Eastern\nUnion models, but slightly different..."
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"Only rats hide under the floor planks."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"What is this place...?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"We could easily hide here for even longer periods of time..."
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"I didn't travel here just to hide under a rock. You can do whatever\nyou like of course."
\N[16] is standing here and waiting for your orders.
Looks like some kind of an operation was planned here that took place\naround Prehevil area...
There are 4 locations that seem especially important.
You copy the markings to your map.
GabText You find the speakeasy of the club from the downstairs!
The gun rack is full of rifles.
The rifles vary wildly in model and condition. They are most likely\nleftovers and/or stolen from both Bremen and Eastern Union military.
Most of the them seem to require maintenance. One rifle seems to be\nin a pristine condition though.
You pick up a \c[2]Rifle .303 Mk I\c[0] and 3 \c[2].303 Ammo\c[0].
Most of the them seem to require maintenance.
You pick up a \c[2]Rifle .303 Mk I\c[0].
The gun rack is full of rifles and other guns.
Most of the them seem to require maintenance. One trenchgun seems \nto be in a pristine condition though.
You pick up a \c[2]12-gauge Trenchgun\c[0] and 4 \c[2]12-gauge shells\c[0].
There's nothing useful left here.
You pick up a \c[2]Lugr Pistol\c[0] and 4 \c[2]9mm Bullets\c[0].
There is also a \c[2]Coded letter #1\c[0] under the pistol.
GabText A smell that is a mix of dirt, blood and feces fills the air.
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"Hey hey! We might have a truce, but I'm not the keeper of my\nbros."
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"I'd get away from these sewers as fast as possible if I were you."
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"Virgin skin folks like you aren't welcome here."
"Do you live down here?"
"What happened to the people?"
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"The survivors of the bloodshed mostly took refugee from these\nsewers yeah."
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"I hear the fancy folk locked themselves inside the museum though."
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"Not a pretty sight, eh?"
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"It's itchy and scratchy."
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"So itchy it makes you kinda mad, you know?"
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"Kinda makes you want to scratch every virgin face around."
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"Don't worry. I won't claw your face for now."
"What is going on in this city?"
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"The Festival of Termina. You know it!"
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"You folks are the third festival already."
"Third?"
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"The first festival, it was just us the Prehevilian folks."
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"The second festival was once the soldiers of the Empire marched here."
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"Then you came."
"Doesn't the festival end after everyone's dead?"
"What is causing this?"
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"Who knows? But what if you don't want to kill your family and \nloved ones?"
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"This happens."
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"You slowly lose your mind and become like us."
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"You end up killing each other anyway."
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"I'm one of the lucky ones, I still got my rugged-good looks."
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"Some of my friends got real twisted and nasty."
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"Don't be stupid. You've seen the dream too." 
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"It's the moon."
\>\i[76]\}OONSCORCHED\{\<\n"The moonlight changes you man."

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Sure looks like that..."
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Hey-o!!"
"H e y - o!!"
Echo answers to Marina.
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Your turn!"
"Hey-o!"
"We should stay quiet and cautious."
"What are you - like an eight years old?"
Echo answers to you.
\>\i[76]\}ARINA\{\<\n"Oh right. Sorry."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"I feel sick... Where's the nearest exit?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"The wheelchair is a nightmare down here... And what's even worse -\nI actually have to clean these wheels after this..."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Not going to lie, I was half-expecting a crocodile to show up down\nhere."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Don't even say anything like that out loud! You'll jinx it!"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Mm. True. I'll shut up now."
Levi looks like he's trying to soldier through the bad smell.
\>\i[78]\}'SAA\{\<\n"How come the ancient aqueducts were better maintained than these\ntunnels?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Why do we end up in tight closed spaces wherever we go?"
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Couldn't we travel on the ground level just as well?"
The barrel is empty.
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"The bunker connects to the sewers...? That's a strange turn of\nevents."
The shelves have miscellaneous utility items. None of them look\nuseful to you at the moment.
GabText The basement has an aggressive stench of mold and gore.
The shelves are stacked with utility items and miscellaneous school\nsupplies.
An old bucket with mucus and other secretion in the bottom.
You check the pockets of the skeleton...
At first you find nothing, but upon further investigation you notice \na hole in the pocket that hides something...
You find \c[2]Ring of wraiths\c[0]!
A chained skeleton. Looks like remains of a child.
The child has been dead for a long while. Whatever is happening in\nthis city isn't the cause of death.
A bucket that has been used as a toilet pot.
\>\i[84]\}ERMIN\{\<\n\}"Master! I hope you don't mind we eat human."\{
\>\i[84]\}ERMIN\{\<\n\}"The child in chains, very tasty."\{

\>\i[84]\}ERMIN\{\<\n\}"Master, go make a nest after the meal. Here. Material for the nest."\{
You get \c[2]Tobacco\c[0]!
There is a bloody bonesaw here...
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"What is this horrible smell...? What's going on here?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Yup. That's the smell."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Smell of death."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"In a place like this... It's messed up."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Is that... Is that blood on the floor...?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"I can't even begin to imagine what has gone down here..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"How can humans be so cruel...?"
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"This kind of stuff makes me want to become a hermit and move to\na lone shack in the middle of nowhere..."
\>\i[78]\}LIVIA\{\<\n"Just me and the nature..."

\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Can you hear that...? I hear someone, or something slowly walking\nin the darkness..."
\>\i[76]\}ARCOH\{\<\n"Sounds like bare feet."
Levi looks visibly shaken by the basement.
A filthy sink with a couple of bloody teeth in it.
Someone has throw up in the toilet.
A filthy sink.
The shelves have random utility and cleaning products.
GabText The fallen cherub is smacked down!
An overwhelming aura fills the air as you sit down to the confessional.
The claustrophobic little box creates an atmosphere of condemnation\nand spite.
"Forgive me father, for I have sinned..."
"Is there someone there?"
Leave the confessional
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Is that so?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"So tell me, what are the most vile and despicable acts you have\nperformed?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"So that Alll-mer may absolve your sins, of course."
"I have killed..."
"I have lusted for someone I shouldn't have..."
"I've been dishonest..."
"How does this work?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Talk freely. I want to hear what kind of person lies beneath that\nflesh vessel of yours."
It does look like someone is there, but you are not 100% certain.
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Hmmm... I see."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Killing is never a light matter... Tell me, was it a murder or\na killing? Did you plan the act?"
"It was an accident..."
"It was self-defence."
"It was a planned murder."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Often times even the most spontaneous acts can spring from the\ndepths of sub-consciousness."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Accidents can happen, but but that does not cleanse you from the\nresponsibilities."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Given the circumstances, it is not outside the boundaries of what \nis possible..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"That does make things more complicated..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Did you know the person you killed?"
"No, never seen before..."
"It wasn't a 'person' per se..."
"I'd rather not say."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Oh, so it was a personal affair?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Hmm... That just makes the impact that much bigger, am I right?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Hmmm..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"So you must only imagine the damage you've caused. This person\nsurely had family and relatives somewhere..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"They must be mourning now..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Ah. I see, I see..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Tell me, when one has a more monstrous exterior, does it make\nkilling them easier?"
"It wasn't just exterior, it was a monster!"
"Are you suggesting it was a human...?"
"It does make it easier, yes."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"It is a base mechanic of the human mind, to demonize those who\noppose us."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"We can only inspect our actions in retrospective and wonder what\nwe really saw at the time."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"At least you are honest in your words. Even if they speak of \ncruelty."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"A murder is a murder. Yes..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Well then..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Do you feel this killing was justified?"
"No..."
"It was self-defence..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Yet you are in a confessional?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"If you felt it was truly justified, would it be on your conscience\nstill?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Oh yes, sorry about asking such silly questions..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"You wouldn't be here if you felt otherwise."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Self-defence or not, you are in a confessional telling me about\nthis event..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"So surely you don't feel it being a justified slaughter?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"How did you feel afterwards? After the slaughter?"
"I didn't feel anything..."
"I felt ecstatic..."
"I felt remorse and guilt."
"I felt horny."
"I felt like killing myself."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"It can be worrying to realize just how quickly we get used to\nkilling."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"But then again the city is as it is, so I cannot blame you."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"It's not like my hands are entirely clean of blood either."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Ecstatic? Really?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"That is vile."
"Aren't you supposed to be neutral?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"No, that was never part of the deal."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Alll-mer might not judge you, but I surely can, and will."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Are you sure about that?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"This is not just an act? An act of supposed normalcy in fear of\nthe judging eye?"
"No, I really feel bad about it."
"What kind of question is that?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Hm. I see."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Well we'll see about that."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"You know what they say about answering to a question with a \nquestion?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"You are only lying to yourself here."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Silence speaks words."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Oh! Hahaha! Excuse my nervous laughter..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"...But that is just horribly messed up."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"This is the kind of dirt I wanted to hear when I signed up for\nthis, but good man... That is just wrong."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Alll-mer most likely judges you too in this case."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"A life for a life?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"There is justice in that, but why did you only leave it at a\nthought? Why not act upon it?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Cowardice and idleness are among greater sins as well."
"Are you suggesting I kill myself!?"
"What kind of priest are you?"
"You are right..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"I am not suggesting anything. You are the one who brought up this\ntopic."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"That is none of your concern, nor does it have anything to do\nwith this topic."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Well let's move on."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Did your actions have consequences?"
"Nothing to speak of..."
"I was rewarded..."
"Everything has consequences in life."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"So you got away with a murder?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"That must be ideal to you."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"That must deepen your guilt even more..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"You could view it as a second chance. If you wanted to be optimist\nabout it."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Oh my. Mysterious are the ways of Alll-mer."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Now it is another question whether this reward will always remind\nyou of this occurence or not."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Very true."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"It is not always you who has to live with the consequences though."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Now the important question is... Are you going to continue on\nthis path of massacre, or was this just a single occurence?"
"I will kill again if I have to."
"I will try not to resort to this again..."
"I can't get enough of it."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Yes... It is good not to make empty promises."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Sounds like you have resolved your inner conflict by yourself."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"To absolve your sins, do a ritual sacrifice or two and you should\nbe good."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"..And try to get good sleep, eat your vitamins and love your \nneighbour."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"That is all."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"To absolve your sins, you would need to feel remorse, I do not\nthink that is the case."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Just get out there and paint the streets red for all I care."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Yes, that is all we can truly do. To aspire for better."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Jumping straight to the juicy bits I see."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Good. Good..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Tell me, is he or she one of your fellow people from the train?"
"Yes. How did you know?"
"No, someone else entirely."
"I rather keep this anonymous."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Interesting..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Does she have a red hair?"
"Yes! How did you know?"
"It's not 'she'."
"This is getting uncomfortable..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"I see. I see..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Oh..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"My apologies. I didn't mean to assume things."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Does she have a light hair?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"No?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Hm. Is that so?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Where did you get acquainted with this person then?"
"At school..."
"At work..."
"The person is a relative..."
"Through a friend of mine..."
"Just a random person."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Shared experience and shared growth is fertile grounds for affection.\nIt is only normal to grow feelings for your peers."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Is that so...?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Oh yes... I see."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Interesting."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Fair enough."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Do you think this person has mutual feelings?"
"I don't know."
"I'd hope so..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"That can be gut-wrenching. I'm sure everyone of us can relate to\nthat feeling."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Actually no... Now that I think about it, I have never been\nrejected."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Well I have a vivid imagination, so I can imagine what you are\ngoing through."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"So could this be forbidden love?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Very interesting."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"So you've kept your feelings hidden?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"One can hope, and in hope it is good to live..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"So let us cut to the chase - Why is this lust condemned? Or\nwhy do you feel it is not appropriate?"
"The person is with someone else..."
"The society condemns our relationship."
"I do not deserve the affection of the person."
"The person is a close relative of mine."
"To lust is to sin."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"It wouldn't happen to be with this 'friend' you mentioned earlier?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"That does complicate things quite a bit..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Oh, that does complicate things..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"But the person answers to your affection, so am I wrong in assuming\nthat you do not want to hurt this third wheel in this tale?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"It sounds like a difficult scenario."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Ahh..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Are you sure about this? Sometimes people can be more open than\nwhat the old taboos would lead you to believe."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Of course sometimes people can act out of fear of the unknown and\ncondemn everything that is alien to them."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"And... sometimes you're the one who is wrong. Not all things should\nbe experimented with. And not all taboos need to be pushed."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"You won't know what is the case, before you proclaim your love\nout in the public."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Maybe your problems don't lie in the lustful thoughts after all..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"It is your self-confidence that sounds like lacking."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Oh?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Well, well... That is a pickle..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Can't say I could find the words to help you, my child."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Where have you heard such claims?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"I thought people from the western world were relatively open with\ntheir lust, premarital sex and whatnot."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"I've heard such talk among certain followers of Alll-mer, but\nthere are no such rules or writings in the old texts."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Such beliefs are usually born out of jealousy and desire to \ncontrol."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"I know this is not a pleasing topic for you to discuss, but I have\none more question."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Have you acted upon this lust in any way?"
"I've pleased myself thinking of the person..."
"I've seen dreams of this person..."
"I've exchanged gazes with the person..."
"I've thought of the person while being with others..."
"I tried to take the person by force..."
"I haven't done anything."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Well I say!"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Hopefully it was a good one at least."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"I would appreciate some details."
"We were together in the dream."
"It was a wet dream."
"I don't want to talk about it."
"It was an inappropriate dream."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Ah. Those dreams are a double-edged sword. On one hand you \nexperience all the warmth this person has to offer..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"But ultimately you will have to wake up and realize that the \ncold reality awaits you."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"There is no shame in letting our sub-consciousness free in a\ndream state."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"And the person has answered to your gazes?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"It is a fine line on what is appropriate and what is considered \nharrasment."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"But I will give you the benefit of the doubt."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"I see, I see..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"You should not worry about it too much in that case."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"No one can condemn us just because of the thoughts we have."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"We are moving on to a territory that could better be handled by\nthe law enforcing individuals of this city."
"I thought you should react neutral?"
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"That was never part of the deal. I can condemn you all I want."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"In this case I don't think even Alll-mer would look past your\nactions."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"I hope to god, you didn't end up hurting this person physically.\nMental damage is already done no question..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"So it is only a thought so far..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"To be frank, I think you are beyond help."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"If the time comes and your one true god Alll-mer judges you at\nthe gates of eternity..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"It is not a favourable situation for you."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"That is quite a broad topic."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"To whom were you dishonest?"
"To my partner..."
"To a friend of mine..."
"To my parent..."
"To a stranger..."
"I'd rather not say..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"I see how that could be on you conscience."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"It is but a sign of good nature to feel remorse even for mere \nfriends and acquaintances."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Depending on your relationship with them, this could be very\ndrastic or nothing at all."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"I have to say it's is rather exceptional to feel remorse for\na random stranger. But please do go on..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"How would you measure this dishonesty? Is it just a white lie,\nor a skeleton in your closet?"
"Just a white lie..."
"Medium lie..."
"A skeleton in a closet..."
"A cruel betrayal..."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"That doesn't sound too bad."
\>\i[67]\}EEP-VOICED PERSON\{\<\n"Sometimes a little white lie can go to great lengths in protecting\nothers from greater harm."

There is something written here...
"Echoing the words of the light, to vouch for the candour of their\nmessage:"
"The stairway to the court of Rher is granted only for the ones who\ntake part in the festival of the moon."
"Trials of cruelty and betrayal. Only the one who is last found \nstanding will be worthy."
A large stone door stands tall before you.

\>\i[75]\}EVI\{\<\n"I know it sounds crazy... But... I have a strong feeling about\nthis..."
Your heart beats loud as a drum just by being so close to the tower. \nAdrenaline is rushing through you. You cannot explain this feeling...
You are at the same time both terrified and tempted to touch the \nintricate ornaments of the ancient stone slab door...
Touch it
You feel energy flowing to the door through your fingertips.
You feel euphoric.
Nothing happened.
"Echoing the words of the darkness, to vouch for the candour of their\nmessage:"
You feel dizzy being this close to the monolith... Your sight\nbecomes blurry and you can hear your blood rush in your veins.
You feel an intense aura eminating from the figure in yellow. You\nare petrified in fear and awe as this person lays its eyes on you.
The presence feels old, almost ancient. You get a feeling that\nthis person is not just a normal human.

The Moon God grew disinterested in you and slowly drifted away.
You've become a witness to something beyond your comprehension.\.\.\nYou've seen something you shouldn't have.
As you slowly regain your consciousness, you realize you're not \nthe same person as you were still just a brief moment ago.
You wake up to a new reality. Suddenly the dark void above you feels\nthat much larger, almost infinite. There are things in this world \nbeyond your understading, beyond human understanding.
You are not sure if this feeling is that of enlightenment or that\nof total terror.
The gentle wind on your cheek feels alien. With this newly\nacquired understanding, even the most minor sensations have this\naltered nuance to them. The moonlight tainted your existence.

The only constant in all the papers is the sigil of the long-lost\nolder god, The God of the Depths.
The only constant in all the papers is the letter 'R' reversed.\nWhatever that means.

\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"But alas, the world is much too capricious and chaotic, just like\nyou said it was. It was never to be fully controlled, it will never\nreach true harmony and order."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"I embraced the chaos and saw where it lead me. The endless cycles \nof mankind's struggle for power had to lead somewhere..."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"I twisted the cycles into a spiral. Each cycle pushed us further\nand further from the grasp of the old world, closer to our true\npotential."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"We're now at the climax of that spiral as we speak."

\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"At the very least thanks are in order."

\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"Beyond that door... There is a... a new kind of machination..."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"It's something that mankind has been building towards for thousands\nof years... Depending how you look at it, you could say since the dawn \nof time."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"On your way here you saw the hallway full of people like me, they \neach pursued the same goal in their own way. They each contributed \nto the overarching story knowingly or unknowingly."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"Even I had my own delusions of grandeur. I pursued power, thinking \nthat was the solution..."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"But no matter how powerful I could get, my traces would slowly \nvanish from the collective consciousness with time."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"I've been told that this everlasting chaos is the natural state \nof the universe. That gods and kings come and go. Nothing is meant \nto last forever..."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"But I disagree."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"Humans might have born from the darkness and then thrusted into \nthe chaos... But chaos doesn't exist just for the sake of it."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"Chaos is constantly looking for shape. The reason why it twists \nin agony is because it hasn't found its final form yet."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"A man can find their final shape, but that shape does not represent \nthe humanity as a whole. At best they reach their own potential. Their\nown personal godhood."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"I've witnessed humans reach close to even more abstract final\nforms... Closer to those of the older gods..."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"But no matter how pure they were while still human, not tainted \nby the collective consciusness, at best they could represent only \none aspect of humanity."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"How could they represent anything else?"
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"We each are individuals and we got our own ways of understanding \nthe world. No one manifestation applies to everyone."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"But... The chaos is forcing itself into a shape one way or \nanother."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"There is a way to form one collective consciousness and thus find \nour one final form. This is what all the chaos has been striving for."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"We couldn't reach that state by mimicing the old deities we've \nworshipped for aeons. We had to find the way ourselves."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"This bunker hides the fruits of our labor. The machine god is \nborn and you unleashed it to the world."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"The new age is upon us already."
"I unleashed what?"
"I haven't done anything to that nature!"
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"The Machine god was born once you connected the diverging \nTelelectroscope paths to the Logic and opened up the bunker seal."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"Those were the last necessary steps. Now the Logic is connected\nto hundreds of sub-stations around the world."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"Once a god of this magnitude is born, it will and has existed\nforever."
"Why didn't you activate it yourself?"
"I don't understand any of this."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"I tried."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"I tried to activate the system myself..."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"I started a world wide war to do just that."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"But every step of the way I've met opposition. I could handle armies,\npoliticians, guerilla organizations, even an occasional stubborn new god..."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"But when I finally reached this isolated part of the world, even \nthe older gods stood against me.."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"You saw the shape this area is in?"
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"You probably figured it out yourself that there are greater powers\nat play here."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"I was driven here, underground. I'm not ashamed to admit that\neven I have to retreat at times."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"I'm not sure how you were able to wiggle your way and activate\nthe Logic under the watchful eye of the moon god, but you did it."
\>\i[74]\}AISER\{\<\n"For that I'm forever thankful."

It's hard to tell where the latex suit ends and the trooper \nbegins, but the skin tight outfit does reveal the muscular physique \nof this person.
There is some slightly uncanny about her proportions, but she\ndefinitely is one of the more 'normal' foes you've faced so far.
The sylvian trooper doesn't exactly have any crevices in her body\nto hide any loot.
You took the \c[2]Sylvian trooper head\c[0] as a trophy!
GabText A tranquil lake views opens up in front of you...
You can peek to the alleyway, but you cannot fit through.
Peek
Just an alleyway. Nothing to it.
An empty basket. There are few leaves at the bottom. Maybe it's been\nused for vegetables?
A pile of burnt bodies. They look relatively freshly burned.
Miscellaneous fish remains fill the bucket.
The barrel reeks of fish.
The metal box has some fire extinguishing equipment in it.
None of it seems useful in your situation.
There's nothing left here.
The head has been shot. There isn't enough soil to plant the seed.

\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"I can't even bear to look at the bodies..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"You can hear the waves hitting the shore from here..."
\>\i[64]\}BELLA\{\<\n"It would be nice to live this close to the water.\. In any other\ncircumstance that is."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"The burnt bodies... They seem to have malformations and mutations on\ntheir faces and bodies."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"You don't suppose they burnt the first victims of this 'disease' in\nhopes of stopping its spreading?"
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"It's getting windier the further east we go..."

\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Ah yes..."

\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"As promised, you are entitled to the grand prize/price."

\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"A peek to grandeur and a chance to reach for the illustrious heights."

"I don't care. I'm here to kill you and the Moon God."

\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Impressive... Very impressive indeed..."
Per'kele is dead.

\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"The void that opens up on top of our heads remains a mystery to\nthis day."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Do not fret. There is no shame in backing down."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Wildly and blindly attacking anyone at this point would be a fruitless\neffort anyway."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"And miss the chance of your lifetime? Please at least hear me \nout first before making any hasty decisions."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"You didn't massacre your way up here for nothing."

\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"I apologize for such an unpoetic manner of speech, but..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"What you see in the sky is just a barren stone floating slowly\nin the space."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"The Festival of Termina is Rher's doings, that much is true yes, \nbut those powers are but faint traces left of his existence."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Rher, much like the other older gods left this world long time ago."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"You might still be able to harness some of their powers, but like\nthe festival, it is just a faint voice from the past that grants you\nthose gifts."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Maybe that is evidence of their true strength, that even in their\nabsence, and in some cases death, their powers still linger in this\nworld."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"But without the consciousness behind these powers, their traces\nare nothing more than any other force of nature."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"That force is not there to help you, to harm you or to be worshipped\nby you. It just exist."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"That leads me to you..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Humans, the common people desperately putting their faith on these\nobsolete powers, they are ultimately alone in this world..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"There is no one looking after you if you were to return to that world.\nNo one looking after you but plenty of forces ready to exploit you \ndown to the bone."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"The world where you came from, where you were driven where they\nwant you and when they want you."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"You were just another pawn in the greater scheme of things. Just\nanother fool lead by the so-called new gods, who are nothing more\nthan dirty little sinners just like yourself..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"The only difference being that they devoured their way to the top\nof the pyramid before anyone else had a chance."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"What do you call the starvation and poverty the world has faced? \nHorrible occurences in history that were inevitable bumps on the path \nof progress?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"What would you call the last two great wars where hundreds of \nthousands, no - millions perished?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"They are but part of the greater scheme. The sinners just pulling their\nstrings from the grand hall they reside in to further establish their\nposition."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"That is vile if you ask me.\. I trust such power to no man. Do you?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Maybe what they say about absolute power really is the absolute truth."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Maybe order and peace truly are just a distant utopia."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"That is why we have chosen chaos."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"What you have gone through since your destined arrival on that fated \nday,\. it would seem that you are no stranger to chaos..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"One could even argue you revel in it whenever possible. My master\ncertainly is pleased of what he has seen."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"A peek to grandeur and a chance to reach for the illustrious heights...\nThey are gifts only offered to select few. Those who possess the right \ntraits..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"If you want to continue on this path of chaos, as The Champion of \nTermina,\. you are given the privilege to join us as equals."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"So...\. What do you say?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Join us or return to the world where you came from as nothing more\nthan a side note in untold history?"
"I'll join you."
"You say the gods are gone, yet you talk about your master..."
"You haven't answered what it is that you do?"
"I've heard enough, it's time for you to die."
"I want no part in any of this."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Well isn't that glorious?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"You have chosen well."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"However...\. One last tribulation lies before you..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"All the souls you sent to our master. Now boiling in the presence\nof his never-ending hatred..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"To finish your transformation I need to send you too to his sulfuric\ncage."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Do not fret, it is like the summer and the winter at the same\ntime. Scorching sun burning your skin, while the long tendrils of\nthe cold freeze you from inside out."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"When you rise back from those dark pits, only then will you be\na true representative of the Cult of Sulfur."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"So as equals we face. I can't wait to tear you to shreds."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Do not die too soon or the ritual will go to waste."
Your wounds are starting to weigh on you...
The world starts fading before your eyes...
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"My master..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Some concepts are beyond words as they would do the reality no \njustice."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"It is shame that human vocalbulary is such limited form of expression."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"But at the back of your head you must know that my master has \nalready visited you and maybe you have even seen glimpses of him...?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"That is really all I can say. At least until you take the leap and\ndecide to follow us on this path of chaos."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"The Moon God... While gone, his traces remain strong. The Festival  \nof Termina is a product of his intense jealousy."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"But like said before, an intense power without conciousness behind \nit is nothing but a raging force of nature, not that unlike a hurricane,\nan earthquake or a volcanic eruption."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Thus the festival itself lacks a greater purpose. We decided to give \nit one."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"The effect it has on people creates an ample opportunity to grow\nour ranks and shed blood for our master."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"For hundreds of years we have followed wherever the Moon God \ntook us and we reaped his harvest instead."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Living and breathing from the chaos that ensues."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Of course we strive for the illustrious heights mentioned many times\nover. But to get there, we must climb a mountain of slain sacrificial\nlambs."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Pity."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"You would rather return back to live as an earthworm even after\nlearning how to cocoon yourself and eventually soar the sky?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Humans never cease to amaze me. Settling into sub-mediocrity..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Have it your way."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"You have earned your freedom in the eyes of my master, however...\. \nOne last tribulation lies before you."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"You see..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"I have followed your journey since the beginning and I've slowly \ncome to the conclusion that I simply hate your existence. Absolutely \ndetest your guts. I can't stand the sight of you."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"This is strictly personal. Between you and me."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"As promised, you are entitled to the grand prize."

\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"I know it sounds redundant. To trade the worship of one god to\nanother. Trading snake oil for quack remedy."

\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"I do not mean a brief moment of happiness, but real joy. One that\nshines through even during your darkest hour."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"You do not need to answer. I know the answer. Humans were born\nto suffer. They possess the eternal hunger that will never be\nsatisfied."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"To fool themselves, they came up with rules and routine to help\npass the time. An artificial sense of achievement. Self-defined\nattributes to determine who is good, bad, successful or a failure."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Living in a cage of their own making. If you live in a cage, you\nare never free."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"You need to tear that prison down, brick by brick. You must strip\nyourself of man-made morals and ethics..."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"The rules and routine to pass the time. You must stop passing the\ntime and jump straight to the end."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"Death awaits at the end. Your only salvation. Witness death, deal \ndeath and finally experience death."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"That is the only way."

\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"You are not curious about the endgame in the slightest?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"So... what is the function of the festival if it lacks greater \npurpose?"
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"We decided to give it one."
\>\i[144]\}ER'KELE\{\<\n"The effect the moon has on people creates an ample opportunity \nto grow our ranks and shed blood for our master."

\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"How hard is it to keep your army within your own borders!?"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"The moment you send your troops over to another sovereign country,\nthat's when this shit stops being self-defence!"
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Disgusting."
Karin spits on the ground.
The door doesn't budge.
GabText It's quiet...
You find a \c[2]One-winged necklace\c[0].
\>\i[74]\}ARIN\{\<\n"Try to walk only in open areas."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"We are happy of your expertise. Having 'covered wars' sure comes\nhandy in situations like these."
There are a lot of chairs here.
The sink has mysterious stains in it.
The toilet is filthy and disgusting, but you suspected as much even\nbefore checking it out.
The stairs have been cut. Looks like someone did this intentionally.
The bed is full of gore. You don't feel like sleeping in it.
It's a television set. There doesn't appear to be electricity here,\nso you cannot use it.
The body is in a horrible condition. It's impossible to tell what\nhas happened to this person.
The bucket has nothing interesting in it. Just random rubbish.
There are only underwear and old socks in the drawer.
A bloody tray.
The sink is dirty. No one in Prehevil seems to know much about\nhygiene and keeping things tidy...
Not a single soul returned from this trip...
\c[2]\v[1816]\c[0] managed to survive through all the horrors...
Only \c[2]1\c[0] managed to survive through all the horrors...
The only soul that returned from the trip was you...
After the events that transpired in your home town, there was no\nlooking back anymore.
It was for the better. You were forced to cut all your ties to the\npast. It was liberating. You were finally free.
...Or that's how it felt for the first few weeks at least. Slowly \neverything you had witnessed started to weigh on you.
To push back all the misery and horrors, you drifted from one place\nto another. Never growing roots to any specific place. Always on the\nrun so you wouldn't have to confront the past...
You'd arrive to a new city, in a new country, do whatever work you\ngot for a while until the events of Prehevil started to invade your\nnightmares once again.
That's when you knew it was time to go once again.
Maybe one day you'd get far enough so the past couldn't follow you\nanymore? Or maybe the past would finally catch up to you?
You didn't have any burden left from your old life. It was a bitter\nsweet feeling. Your ties to your family and past were severed thanks\nto the traumatic events that transpired in Prehevil.
The thought of returning to Vatican City to continue your studies\ndidn't sound appealing. Not after everything you had seen. Some\nthings were not meant for humans to meddle with.
As years went on, you drifted all the way to the country of Valland\nand found yourself settling down at the red lights district of\nthe capital.
You had trouble fitting in with regular people who were unaware of\nthe greater scheme of things, but from the people that inhabited\nthe red lights district you found kindred spirits.
Everyone carried baggage there and no one judged no one.
Occult skills helped you make friends easily and there were many\nways you could make a living there with help of little magic.
Things were pretty nice actually. Now if you could only tell who\nthis photobombing person was... She had been trying to make friends\nwith you for the longest time... Pretty annoying.
Well that solved nothing. All this and you were still none the \nwiser.
Mystic deities, unknown gods, unholy rituals... Nuggets of \ninformation... Were the answers buried somewhere amongst all this\nmadness?
Would the answers even matter anymore? If the baron von Dutch had\ndirtied his hands with blood, then you had reveled in bloodbath in\ncomparison to get where you are now.
You hear the heavy footsteps of that wicked cat. He knows what\nyou've done. In Prehevil and before. The cat is circling around\nyou in the darkness. Just beyond your line of sight.
Maybe you should just take his offer? What else do you got going\nfor you?
Nothing. That's right.
It's peculiar, isn't it old sport? The life that is.
You couldn't sleep after what you had witnessed in Prehevil.\nYou knew too much about the universe and what horrors it hid in\nthe darkness of the night.
The endless void above in the sky taunted you. It laughed at you. \nYou had finally realized how miniscule humans truly were in the \ngrand scheme of things.
Your insomnia almost drew you insane. But you had always been one\nto look for answers and solutions. Surely there was an answer to \nbe found here too.
The moon had paid you a visit and gazed at you for a brief second.\nTo ask for answers, you'd need pay the Moon God a visit too.
You took high positions in fields that studied space technology.\nOver the years, things started to advance and only after a decade\nyou were already getting ready to launch people to the moon.
You'd get an audience with the moon soon. Not with ancient rituals\nor occult, but thanks to technology and human wit.
Whether it was a good idea remains to be seen...
The cult of sulfur... the followers of Rher... the church of \nAlll-mer... Were they any different from yellow mages?
They all served someone else ultimately. Your master just happened\nto be a foul mouthed old raisin whom the time had forgotten.
You threw your master to the nearest lake. Maybe some poor bastard\nwould find him there centuries later and be led like a fool on a\nleash to do their master's bidding. But that was not your part\nany longer.
You returned to Abyssonia, to your homeland.
The reason you had initially left the whole continent was because\nof the state of religion and worship there. The teachings of \nAlll-mer had taken over the old beliefs.
You had gathered enough knowledge and skills on your travels to \nrival what the local temples promoted.
These lands would follow your teachings in the future. Teachings\nthat would benefit the ones practitioning your way. Not the ones\nin power, nor the establishment.
One could almost be fooled into thinking this was an altruistic \nact. Of course in a true yellow mage manner, you'd be the one on \ntop of the pyramid this time around.
Something good actually came from your traumatic experiences in\nPrehevil. It did take years of therapy to realize this, but slowly \nyou understood what you were truly capable of.
You were the Champion of Termina. You. In your wheelchair and\nall. Somehow you were the sole survivor in what took place in\nthat godforsaken backwaters town.
You also started to feel the spirit of your sister as years went\non. She was accompanying you everywhere you went.
You never fully understood what happened to her, but she followed\nyou every step of the way since you two left that wicked city.
You gained courage and confidence from that ordeal. With that newly\nfound confidence you set out on the most remote locations in the\nworld to study their flora and fauna.
You had learned that the nature took care of you no matter where\nyou went. You didn't have limitations of human body anymore.
For the first time in your life, you felt true freedom.
The city of Prehevil was meant to be just a stepping stone on \nyour path to greener pastures. Instead it turned out to be a place \nthat shaped the very person you ended up becoming.
Your sister was waiting for you in the Kingdom of Rondon, that was\nthe plan. She welcomed you unknowing of the horrors you had \nwitnessed on your way there.
You never spoke of your experiences, even if those events ate you\nup every night as you laid down to sleep.
People walked the streets of Rondon every day without knowing what \nwas lurking in the shadows of every dark corner of the world.
It was better that way. It was better that they didn't know how \nhelpless they truly were against the cosmic horrors out there. But \nyou could help them prepare if they ever had to come face to face \nwith anything of that nature.
You started running a boxing gym with your expertise. The attendees\nwould step inside in hopes of learning how to defend against common\nstreet thugs, but they would step outside ready to face the unknown.
Saving people's lives like this even alleviated some of your\ninner guilt. You had taken lives of many, but maybe you could \nfinally give something back as well.
The events of Prehevil shook you to the core. Suddenly many things\nin life felt meaningless against this overwhelming realization of\nwhat hides behind the veil between the known and the unknown.
As you returned back to civilization, you understood that your\nexperiences would sound like ramblings of a mad man if you ever\ntried to put them down on paper.
You needed proof before you could open your mouth. You had witnessed\nthe rumours about the New Gods and Kaiser in real life. You knew\nthey were real.
This was half the job already. Now you only needed to convince the\nrest of the world of this forbidden information.
This goal helped you get by each day. You needed clear goals to\nblock the dread out of your mind.
You started digging. Like you had always done. Sooner or later you\nwould get to the root of things. It remains to be seen whether your\nsanity will withstand the truth or not...

You're not even sure what you're looking at...
Detailed stone carvings fill the wall.

"In my dreams I've seen the towers... The hollow husks of the\nendless city, those who patiently wait for their king to return..."
"The king?"
"It is not the domain of the new gods."
"The carvings depict people joint together under the sun."
"The book is the key. I've seen the macabre murals of the ancient\ncity, I've lost myself in the endless maze of its lone alleyways."
"Return of the king."
"Return of the sun."
"The replica is near perfect."
"It is not the domain of humans."
"At least it didn't use to be."
"Under one sun, people finally join together in the promised land."
"'The sulfur sun' appears in the texts frequently. But I do not\nthink that's the sun referred in the carvings."
"A sun that blazes from underground doesn't match with the passages."
"The sun..."
"The city haunts my waking hours.\nRelentlessly.\nEndlessly."
"After a long night, the dawn finally arrives, inviting us to \nthe promised land."
