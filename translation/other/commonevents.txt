As you finish reading the book, it crumbles into dust\nbefore your very eyes.
The book contains traditional recipes dating back to the 15th \ncentury cuisine.
The recipes are collected from the memoirs of the infamous\nchef Andérs that worked at the royal kitchen of Rondon at the\ntime.
It appears that chef Andérs gained infamy by seducing court \nladies and was even rumoured to had a fling with the princess\nElizabeth, the famous virgin princess.
Now that you look at it, the book seems to be more about royal\ngossip than food recipes...
Between all this romance and betreyal you find recipes of \nchef Andérs' famous \c[2]Meatpie\c[0] and \c[2]Vegetable pie\c[0]!
"What backwater parts these dark corners of the earth really\nare!"
"When I heard about this assignment, I figured the city of\nPrehevil was at least decent sized and there would surely\nbe some entertainment to be had with the local dancers and\nstreet girls."
"But alas, I'm not too keen on getting that comfy with the\nlocals after sightseeing the city a bit..."
"Frankly I'm baffled at how a city of this size has managed \nto stay so isolated from the neighbouring influences and\nmodern times."
"The Prehevil folk still hold on tightly to religious rites\nas old as 'The Fellowship' itself."
"The human sacrifices creep me out in this day and age. Even\nif I've seen the horrors of war, the crucifixes set around\nthe city manage to send a chill down my spine."
"The sights of Ma'habre. You have seen them too, haven't\nyou? In your dreams you wander for one lifetime with\nsilhoutte of this city in horizon.
"You have seen the twin towers that rise next to\na black night sky. Those macabre obelisks telling tales \nof some older, more cruel age.
"You have seen the grand gate with it's maddening\nmurals and spirals. Patterns beyond understanding."
"It's not like the sound of wind, howling between\nthose hollow streets wasn't enough..."
"You also hear the sound of local residents. Even while\nall comphrehension would dictate that this place is\nlong abandoned..."
"...You still hear them. You are not alone in this\nvile part of world."
"In your dreams you have seen it, haven't you?\nThe city of Ma'habre. The city of gods."
"Did you know it exists here?"
"Gro-goroth - The destroyer of men. He who ushers a new dawn \nwith force and violence."
"Gro-goroth is the other part of the most primal duality.\nCreation and destruction. Where the other doesn't exist \nwithout the other."
"The word 'destruction' is often associated with the evil of \nthe world. This of course is foolishness. There is no room\nfor new creation if the slate is not first burnt clean and \nempty."
"A man fears destruction. Man gets accustomed to peace and \nquiet. Man grows fat and afraid of change."
"Change is inevitable, just as Gro-goroth."
"What one needs to understand is that the destruction is of\npure kind. It does not target one man specifically. It just\nexists."
"Gro-goroth is associated with the the god of creation, Sylvian\nand their child, the god of the nature, Vinushka."
"Gro-goroth offers the mankind the blessing of blood magick.\nConstant sacrifices in his name will maintain the relationship."
"The Mark of Gro-goroth raises the physical strength of its\nwearer."
The text includes the sigil of the Gro-goroth and instructions\non how to use it.
"Very much like the sun - the moon is one of the primordial entities \nand thus it has lore and beliefs written since the dawn of time."
"This makes it difficult to separate facts from fiction and mad\nramblings from hidden truths."
"Consistent details among the myriad of stories seem to hint of a \ngod called Rher. Also knowns as the Trickster God and the Moon God."
"In the most ancient of writings Rher is depicted as the god of the\ninsane and those who've succumbed to the madness."
"His blessing to men is his moonlight, which is said to uncover the\ntruth under the human filth. A truth that is often too much for a \nhuman mind to handle."
"It can be debated whether his version of the truth is more accurate \nthan that of the human filth."
"Unlike many of the other older gods, Rher's part in the greater \nscheme of things remains a mystery."
"Just looking at the night sky, you can see his presence, in an\neternal slumber. This makes his secrecy even more infuriating, he\nis literally hiding in plain sight."
"The Mark of Rher raises the maximum capacity of the mind."
The text includes the sigil of the Rher and instructions on how\nto use it.
"The Intermediate Level of Alchemy - Alchemillia vol.2"
"The effects of different coloured alchemic substances are listed\nhere:"
"Yellow + Oil = Highly flammable"\nBlue + Fly Amanita = Antidote for the poison\nGolden chantarelle + Golden chantarelle = Nutritious liquid."
"Conceived by the black. Born from the clay. Shaped by\nour fears. Forged by the sins of her parents."
"From eternal darkness and void, she'd bring gloom."
"The hubris of man brought this upon us, but it is not\nbecause of cruelty, it is because of wisdom. Only through\nhardship could we see the errors of our ways."
The book radiates light in every color of the spectrum.
You feel like your journey has just began. As if your existence \nsince this very moment has been like watching someone else \nentirely.
You feel a perspective shift in your surroundings. As if \neverything was to shrink, or perhaps you were to ascend \nhigher.
You gain better understanding of yourself. The link between \nyour mind and body has started it's deterioration.
You feel closer to enlightenment.

"-The Tale of the Pocketcat -\n"This is a tale about the Pocketcat, the friend of the children, but\nonly a friend, nothing more."
"Willem, the wildest child known to the little town of Merwood spent\nanother afternoon watching raindrops dance against the window."
"It had been raining without a stop for the whole week and Willem, the\nrestless boy he was, grew even more restless."
"His mother would warn him of going outside during an usettled weather.\nThe rain brings forth all kinds of dangers otherwise unknown to little \nboys."
"Besides decent children would help their parents with various \nhousehold chores during this kind of dreich."
"Willem, the restless boy he was, disregarded the warnings and slipped\nout without a worry in the world."
"He dashed through the bushes and ran deep in the heart of the Merwood."
"The first horror to befall on him was a two-day-old carcass of a once\nbeautiful deer, now defiled by the pest of the forest floor devouring\nits remains."
"The second horror poor little Willem witnessed was an age-old slowworm\ncaught in the middle of an ant colony. Slowly the slowworm sank deeper \nand deeper to its inevitable doom as the ant nest consumed it torso."
"In the heart of the forest, all wet from the rain, Willem\nheard slight panting noices from an overgrown grotto nearby..."
"Cautiously Willem peeked through the leaves..."
"He would not believe his eyes when he saw a finely dressed \ncat standing on two feet, twice as tall as Willem's father \nwould be."
"The cat's back was facing Willem. Its hand was moving\nswiftly inside its pocket while the two big yellow eyes  \nglee'd inside a burlap bag in great excitement."
"Suddenly the hand movement came to a halt."
"Even if Willem was well hidden behind the leaves - slowly \nthe cat turned it's eyes towards him."
"In terror Willem ran as fast as he could towards his home!"
"The two glowing yellow eyes of the cat haunted him all the\nway to his home gates."
"His mother was there to meet him by the front door.\n'So you just had to go to the woods, did you?' - said\nhis mother."
"'You saw something you shouldn't have, right!?' - questioned \nhis mother. 'And how do I know this?'"
"Willem's mother would go inside to get a little parcel with \ndecorated wrappings."
"'This appeared on the front door just before you came. \nIt was directed to young mister Willem.'"
"Slowly Willem unwrapped the decorated paper with small\nmouse prints on it..."
"Inside the parcel, there was catnip."
"-The Four Ages of Modern History-"\n"The modern age and modern chronology begins from the birth \nof our lord , the ascended one, Alll-mer."
"There are many fabricated religious text about Alll-mer, but\nthere is enough evidence to prove that Alll-mer did indeed\nexist as a real person at the time.
"His birth would mark as the first age. The second age started\nfrom the reign of the so-called New gods in the year 410."
"There are texts about different new gods prior to this event,\nand the concept did exist in ancient times as well, but this\ngroup of people included the famed warlord from the Eastern \nSanctuaries, Nash'rah the great."
"This alone made this group more distinguished compared to\nthe ones that came before."
"Their world order started a slow decline few hundred years\nafter their deaths, only to be ended by 'The fellowship'\naround year 800."
"The popular book 'The Fellowship' inspired the comtemporary\npeople of the time and lifted the four people of the fellowship -\nFrancóis, Chambara, Nilvan and Valteil to a near god-like status.
"Their age would last until the end of the 16th century.\nThe western world was in a dark age at the time and out of\nnowhere appeared a new idol of worship, the god of Fear\n& Hunger."
"People forgot the teachings of the old in times of diseases\nand death and turned on to this new saviour."

"This manual depicts basics of survival in a close-combat situations,\nas well as on the field. The following teachings can be applied both \non the battlefield and in your everyday life."
"\c[2]Lesson 1 - Strategic Dismemberment\c[0]\nSever different limbs of the enemy to best subdue their attacks.\nIf the enemy is carrying a weapon, it might be best to deal with \nthat particular limb first."
"Going straight for the head might seem tempting, but attacking such\nguarded bodypart in the heat of the battle might prove out to be \ndifficult."
"Taking out legs will often rock the balance of the enemy and make \nthem vulnerable for head shots."
"\c[2]Lesson 2 - Rev Up\c[0]\nAs the fight goes on, you will get more rev'd up naturally as\nindicated with your \i[175] Points increasing every turn."
"Use one or two \i[175] Points to boost your strength, or three to \nadd an additional attack to your string."
"There are also different skills that require Rev Points. These are \nmentioned in the skill descriptions."
"\c[2]Lesson 3 - Devastating Attacks\c[0]\nSometimes the enemy might be preparing for a Devastating Attack.\nThese attacks cause massive damage or other status ailments that \nprove out to be insufferable."
"Most of the time these attacks are telegraphed somehow on the\nprevious turn and you can see them coming. You can either dodge \nDevastating Attacks by guarding or you can risk it and face the \nCoin of Judgement."
"The Coin of Judgement is your last chance in dodging the incoming\nattack. You can affect your chances by throwing a \c[2]Lucky coin\c[0] into \nthe mix by holding [SHIFT] key while you choose either Heads or \nTails."
"Ultimately your fate will be chosen by the higher powers."
"\c[2]Lesson 4 - Shooting\c[0]\nYou can use various different firearms on the field, before even\ninitiating a combat encounter, to weaken or to kill the enemy before\nthey get to the striking distance."
"Just have a firearm equipped, some ammo to spare and press [SHIFT].\nThe effects of your attack vary from enemy to enemy. Weaker foes\nmight even get killed from a single hit."
"\c[2]Lesson 5 - Running\c[0]\nHold [SHIFT] to run. Running slowly depletes your stamina. If you\nrun out of stamina entirely, you'll need a short recovery time to\ncatch your breath before being able to run again."
"If an enemy spots you, you will go into Tension mode where stamina \ndepletes at an alarming rate. This tense moment will luckily pass by\nfairly fast."
"If you have firearms equipped, you can't run. No running and\ngunning. If you have injured your legs, no running either."
"There is a lot more to survival, but hopefully these lessons will\naid you to get started. Good luck."
It is a week-old newspaper article about the supposed end of \nthe Great War II.
"...Two of the biggest powers in the western world - The\nEastern Union and the Bremen settled for peace after the last \naggressive push by the Bremen troops happening just days prior\nto the treaty."
"The Bremen troops seized the power in a small city of\nPrehevil, located in central Bohemia, just west from Lake\nVerdite."
"The last push was considered especially aggressive and it\nis widely considered to have advanced the peace agreements\non a larger scale."
"Another major factor behind the peace was the joined assaults\nagainst the Eastern Union on both the western and eastern \nfronts."
"From the west, the remnants of the Kingdom of Rondon kept\nattacking the Eastern Union and from the east, the Kingdom of\nEdo continued their campaign after their prior defeats..."
The article goes on and on about the small details, but that\nseems to be the gist of the article.
The letter is encrypted by someone from the Nameless Liberty \nUnderground. It uses the same code language taught to you at \nthe NLU headquarters. You take a closer look...
"Eastern Union officials from both Voroniyan Republic as well \nas from Eastern Sanctuaries don't understand what they are giving\nup."
"I tried to emphasize the importance of the project Logic during \nmy time with the research, yet they cannot see its true potential. \nEastern Union is willing to let go of Prehevil for a very cheap \nprice."
"The leaked documents say the officials are stupid enough to \nthink they even got a good deal out of it. They don't understand \nwhat they are handing over to Kaiser on a silver platter."
"But Kaiser knows."
"I first met him briefly during my scholarship at the compound \nall those years ago. It sounds like Kaiser knows perfectly well \nwhat the project has been building towards..."
"...in fact from the pieces I was able to gather, it sounds\nlike he was one of the main forces kickstarting the project long \nbefore The Great War started and pitted Bremen and Eastern Union \nagainst each other. -R"
Looks like a coded letter... Or a child's prank.

"The Last Frontier - The Vinland Coloniale - Chapter 1."
"The legends report that in the year 1009 a group of \nexplorers from Oldegård first made contact with the island\nregion of Vinland."
"This is the first written record of the continent. The\nnext confirmed case dates back to year 1310 when a small \nfleet from Abyssonia ventured to the dark waters of the \nwest."
"However it would take another 200 years before an \nestablished trade route would be formed, again by the \nseafarers of Oldegård in the year 1577."
"It was during this escapade that the continent was named\nVinland, translating to 'Wine Land' supposedly because of\nthe amount of wine required to wipe the memories clean of\nthe land and the horrors it contained."
"Despite the existence of the continent becoming more \ncommon knowledge among the scholars of the western world,\nventures to the said land were very rare."
"In the year 1650, a scholar from the Vatican City wrote\nthe following description of the land:"
"The soil consists of minerals that seem to reject sunlight\nand warmth altogether resulting the ground to look like\na contiguous colourless black mass where it is hard to\nmeasure depth of each hill and basin with a naked eye."
"And the few plants that manage to grow in this hostile \nground end up taking these very same features. Thus the\nlandscape merges together as far as the eye can see."
"Just endless darkness. If you are lucky, the clouds might\nshift a little and you can at the very least tell where\nthe land ends and where the gloomy sky begins."
"The land is cursed. The land is morbid and dark."
"Each settler comes back with vivid stories of very personal \nnightmares they went through during their stay in Vinland."

"In future I'll hide the tool box. I got the perfect spot in\nmind already."
"When you enter the second hall, you know those statues? They are\npointing, one to another. Just follow their lead. The last one \npoints at the spot near the wall. I'll leave the box under the \nfloor tiling there."

"The Midnight Gazette, January 31, 1936 \nAppointment of Kaiser as Bremen chancellor has been made \nofficial today."
"In approximately 14 years Kaiser has brought into being the \ngreatest popular movement Bremen has ever seen. In fact one \nof the greatest that history registers."
"This mysterious man who seems to remain in secrecy under\nhis now trademark hood rose to popularity seemingly out of \nnowhere."
"But just witnessing him giving one of his famous speeches \nto masses makes it very obvious why both the high and low \nclass fell under his charms. Kaiser's energy is a sight to \nbehold."
"In a short amount of time Kaiser has managed to unite the\nmid-western nations under the flag of Bremen."
"He formed the special troops 'The Marching Men of the Nights \nDay' which effectively have been expanding the Bremen reign at \na rapid rate."
"A rate that has made the leaders of The Eastern Union worried. \nWhere these turns take the world cannot be foreseen."
"His acts can very well be described as vile and monstrous, \nbut only future history can tell if his means justify the  \nends."
"The Midnight Gazette, September 17, 1942\nThe formation of 'The Marching Men of the Nights Day' marked \nthe day Europa officially jumped the shark."
"There are conflicting stories as to whether the Bremen army \nhas truly succumbed to the horrors the rumours speak of, but \nit is clear as a day, that something vile is brewing under\nthat black and yellow banner of Kaiser's Bremen."
"Especially the campaigns that took place in the area of \nBohemia. Kaiser pursued this area with such vigor, that it \nis without a question his endgame."
"It is hardly a coincidence that Kaiser is opening up the \ntalks about the peace treaty right after his Bremen pig occupy\nPrehevil, the capital of Bohemia."
"The Kingdom of Rondon and the allied forces suspect that this \nwhole Bremen ambition is directly linked to the advanced \nelectronic network experiments the Eastern Union has been \nconducting in the area."
"It is beyond me how the masses fail to see through these \nplans. Instead they give credence to Kaiser's madness and \nplace more trust in his perversions than logic."
"There are no rational answers to the irrational ideologies\nwhich Kaiser brings to the table. - An article written by\nKarin Sauer."

"Alll-mer - The ascended one. One of the two humanborn gods known \nto this day."
"There are two stories of the origins of Alll-mer."
"The more common story speaks of a human born from a virgin \nmother. A mere mortal that had humble origins, but one that quickly \nrose to prominence because of his teachings."
"Unlike the warring kings and sultans of the time, Alll-mer's ideal \nworld united people of all different religions and ideologies under\none umbrella."
"The powers of the time wouldn't stand up for this and quickly \nhad him arrested and sentenced for a public humiliation and eventual \ndeath on a cross."
"This only served Alll-mer's purpose, making him a martyr and \nthe pain he went through pushed him over the edge to his ascension \nto the true godhood."
"After his ascension, Alll-mer returned to avenge his death. \nThe bloodbath that ensued shook the world order and demolished the\nworship New Gods of the time had been enjoying."
"The other version of Alll-mer's origins tells how Sylvian, the\nolder god of fertility ordered a deity known as Vitruvia to create \nan architectural reprography of a man and a woman that would be \nto the likeness of Sylvian herself."
"Vitruvia, being the master architect, did just that. Sylvian fell\nin love with the results. She went on and created the mankind \naccording to Vitruvia's drawings."
"At first Vitruvia was amazed by the life Sylvian managed to usher \ninto her designs. However, over time Vitruvia started to see small \nimperfections here and there."
"Nothing bothered her more than the idea that her designs were\nanything but perfect."
"So she set out to create the perfect human being. The pinnacle of \nman's potential."
"This being was born on the year nil and he is the one known as\nAlll-mer today."
"On the surface level these stories don't contradict with \nthemselves too much. But on an ideological level there are\ninteresting differences."
"The other story tells how a mortal everyday man rose to rival\nthe powers of older gods, while the other story makes Alll-mer \njust one more creation of the higher powers."
"The truth might lie somewhere between these stories if you'd\nask me."
"The Mark of Alll-mer raises the physical protection of its wielder."
The text includes the sigil of the Alll-mer and instructions\non how to use it.

"The only logical explanation I can come up with is that the people\nin this immediate area are under a mass psychosis of some kind."
"It's not too rare for such to occur in the times of continued war,\nlike the times we live in. As an example for comparison, there was \na mass psychosis brewing in the Empire of Bremen after the first \ngreat war as well."
"The VRIL society were stirring up public unrest among the working\nclass. Their villainous front figures raved like a mad men and were\nable to enchant the vast majority of the country."

"Maybe the whole Bremen was destined to cannibalise its own in\na never-ending bloodbath, not too different from the recent events\nin Prehevil?"
"There is very little work for a doctor here anymore."
Most parts of the diary are completely illegible scriblings of\na madman, but towards the end, the text becomes more lucid.
"Dream of the moon. The sign. The city is in upheaval."
"Fools. They don't know what awaits them."
"The moon is of no value to me. It is but a mark of a trigger. \nThe time has come. And so has he."
"As you are my witness, I am ready my lord. I have gone through \nthis a thousand times in my head."
"The first blood - The one who talks only to her plants."
"The second blood - His puppets will bear witness to his sacrifice."
"The third blood - The foolish braggart who just moved in."
"The fourth blood and the final sacrifice - The girl who keeps\nme up at night. The songbird that utters her last whimpers."
"To finish the ritual, I need time. The laundry room works as a\nperfect hiding place for the sacrificed."
"I will swear on your name my lord, our one true leader, the Sulf--"\nThe writing becomes too hard to read past this point.
"The seed of Gro'goroth that had been fermenting for an aeon, \nfinally reached its maturity, and thus Sylvian pushed a whole \npinecone out of her loose abyss and named her child Ninush."
"The cycle of destruction and creation is seen in its purest form\nin nature. Thus it comes as no surprise that the very god of nature,\nVinushka is an offspring of the two older gods Gro-goroth and Sylvian."
"Like the nature of mankind, the nature of Vinushka too can change\nfrom fiery raging volcanos to serene grasslands where a gentle wind \nlulls one to sleep."
"The ancient tribes of men used to live in a symbiosis with the \nnature, with its cycles of destruction and creation."
"But people grew greedy and hostile towards the land they settled\nand ravaged the nature to give room for their own civilizations."
"As people grew greedy and hostile, so did Vinushka."
"A long war was waged to determine who was to become the master \nand who the slave. To everyone's surprise, or at least to my\nsurprise, this resulted in the demise of Vinushka."
"For all tense and purposes the nature is dead. Vinushka died by\nthe hands of men."
"From this grievous realization comes the name of the god. 'Vinushka'\nmeaning guilt, the great guilt of mankind."
"This guilt will surely eat away the known world in time. For now\nfaint traces of the god still linger in Vinushka's totems, deities\nthat desperately search for the murdered god in vain."
"Maybe these totems are the manifestation of human guilt. Once they\nunderstand the events that took place, mankind will surely feel\ntheir grief too."
"For now it's best to exploit the nature while we still can.\nThe Mark of Vinushka raises the otherwordly offence of its wielder."
The text includes the sigil of the Vinushka and instructions on how\nto use it.
"- The truth under the moonlight -"
"Who of us doesn't cover their true face and hide behind a persona?"
"In the broad daylight we adopt a social role depending on the\nsurrounding people. We put on a mask that works as the public image\nof our true personality."
"Do we hide our face to avoid the judgement of the people, or do\nwe look down in shame as the sun watches our every move?"
"A sun that knows our deepest longings and lustful thoughts."
"Only in the darkness of the night does the true and vile nature \nof men get revealed. We share our decrepit bodies only to the select\nfew under the moonlight."
"Despite what lowly thieves, covering in the shadows, would like you\nto think, the moonlight hides no one."
"The similarities between the nature and mankind are fitting as\nboth grew up sucking the many bosoms of Sylvian after all. Both \nwere born from the same loins."
"Vinushka and the represenation of humanity, Alll-mer the Ascended\nOne are considered equal. Neither of the two stands taller."
"What is Vinushka's, is for the men to reap, just as the nature\nreaps our old and weary."
"The Mark of Vinushka raises the otherwordly offence of its wielder."
"...Looking back at the history of this place - There has been\nsettlement here for as long as the history books cover the area. It\nhas always centered around the mysterious Hollow Tower that works as \nthe central pillar of the community."
"The city flourished during the cruel age in the 1600s, but it \nquickly fell from prominence the closer we got to the modern times."
"I understand the city is medium in size as far as cities in\neastern Europa go, but still I find it hard to believe that this\nplace would serve as a hub of any kind in a civilized world."
"For some reason the goverment officials insist that Prehevil keeps \nits capital identity despite it being one of the more remote and \nunwelcoming cities in all of Bohemia, if not all of Europa."
"The only explanation I can come up with is that the country is proud\nof the old archaic rites that still go down in this city and they \nwant to show their full support."
"If you were to visit Prehevil and sightsee its small center, you'd\nsee glimpses of its ancient glory days, still well and alive in these\nmodern times."
"Do not let the western style shopping district with its latest\nmovie posters and advetisements fool you, the locals still worship\nthe old world order in the dank and crumling parts of the town."
"Ritualistic murder sites are just around the corner no matter where\nyou are in the city. While the churches look to be dedicated to our\none true god Alll-mer from the outside, insides tell a whole different \nstory."
"Ancient gods without name in any known language still linger in\nthose crypts. And why wouldn't they? You can hear the priests chant \ntheir masses in the moonlit alleys during the dead of the night."
"The whole wicked city is a playground for the ancient beings and\nthe people living there offer themselves to the first taker without\nsecond thought."
"The God of Fear and Hunger - There are popular texts that tell \nstories of a false god and a chosen human joining together in the \ndarkest and the wettest of dreams."
"The forgotten and long dormant God of the Depths perished that\nnight. Only an older god never truly perishes. In its stead, the \nGod of Fear and Hunger planted its roots and started to grow her \ninfluence on the surface world."
"The scheming false deity had hoped her daughter would be the \nlight of mankind. Only true darkness does not breed light."
"The god of Fear and Hunger was a pure child, a blank slate birthed\nin the darkest pits of human creation. That is where she grew, that\nis all she knew."
"She was the pure representation of fear and hunger, not spoiled by\neven a glimmer of hope."
"Mankind had seen its share of stagnation and suffering up to\nthat point. To rise from those perilious pits, growing pains were \nnecessary. Progress comes at a price."
"Fear motivated people while hunger kept them moving forward."
"People cherished their hardship and drew inspiration from it.\nThey learned from it. What followed was advancement the mankind\nhad not seen since the forgotten ages."
"The dark fumes that rise from the pipes of modern cities are\ndirect consequences of this era. An era that came to be known\nas the Cruel Age."
"The Mark of Fear and Hunger raises the agility of its wielder."
The text includes the sigil of Fear and Hunger and instructions on \nhow to use it.

\>\i[144]\}OCKETCAT\{\<\n"Happy to do business with you~!"
"Have you seen this man in dreams?"
"Over the past week or so, since the full moon, people all over\nPrehevil and its neighbouring settlements see this face in their\ndreams, every night."
"If you are one of them, or if you have any information that can\nhelp us identify this person, please contact us."
The flyer tells to contact 'us', but there's no contact information\nto be found from the flyer.
"Furniture moving without a reason, flickering lights, a television \nset turning on, all on its own. These are usually the first signs \nof a shadow presence or a spirit trying to contact you from the \notherside." 
"There is no need to be scared about this. Spirits vary and there\nare as many types as there are personality types among the living.\nSome are kind, some are hostile."
"You can confirm a spirit presence using the talking board. \nAsking a simple opening question like 'Is anyone out there?' or \n'Can you hear me?' opens up a connection between you two."
"If a spirit wants to communicate with you, you will get a\nvery clear physical confirmation of this with the planchette \n(the heart-shaped indicator) moving on its own."
"Spirits can only manifest before you when you are close enough\nto them. If a spirit is willing, it can lead you to it using the\ntalking board as its means of communication."
"Follow the spirit instructions bravely and perhaps you can learn\na thing or two from our brothers and sisters from another plateau*."
"*'Another plateau' meaning in this instance the otherside, the\nafterlife or the spirit realm."
"I have read contrary beliefs, ridiculous beliefs even, from facets \nnot to be named here. From an effete facet well known in occult \ncircles despite his biased view on the world of the otherworldly."
"Just because this not-to-be-named dark priest wrote a book that\nis citated in most occult studies, doesn't mean his word shouldn't\nbe taken with a pinch, no - with a jar of salt."
"Words about the death of an older god especially are nothing short\nof absurd."
"How do you kill an idea, an inspiration or one of the primordial \nconcepts once it is conceived? The thought will forever haunt your \nmind as long as our consciousness is there to remind us of it."
"Once an older god is born, it has existed forever. A god, like\na human soul is not constrained by linear time and space. It can\nreincarnate multiple times within our history and future history\nwithout us knowing any better."
"They spawn from the green stream, but which spawns first, an\nolder god in its physical form or the concept our consciousness\ngave birth to?"
"The mockery that is 'the new gods', the puppets yearning to \nbecome the puppeteers, should never be mistaken with the gods that\ndwell beyond our understanding."
"They are but byproducts of the immense influence the older gods\nhold on us. Just by flying too close to the sun, or why not moon, and \none can attain a glimpse of the true intensity that is older gods."
"Men inherited the power from the beasts that walked before us.\nHow could such power come even close to that of older gods?"
"In my dreams I'm free."
"That is my light at the end of the tunnel. The light that keeps\nme going."

"- The Tale of the Pocketcat - Chapter 1 -"
"It was a rainy day in the countryside just north from the forest\nof Merwood."
"Willem, the most mischievous child known in the town, stared at\nthe rain drops behind his window screen, just longing for an adventure."
"His mother would warn him of going outside. Rain brings forth all \nkinds of dangers not otherwise known to little boys. During downpours \ndecent boys should help their parents with various household chores\ninstead."
"Being the pompous boy he was, Willem refused to give a helping\nhand. The consequences of such refusals were all too familiar to \nWillem. He'd get sentenced to bed without a dinner. And so he did."
"Crying under his blanket, fits of Willem's anger brought forth his \nreflection from a mirror on the wall."
"The boy from the mirror introduced himself as Melliw, the sleeping \ntwin brother of Willem that came to this world far too early and\nthus he could only view the world from the land of opposites."
"Melliw wanted to warn his brother of the coming calamity, but \nhis words echoed from the land of opposites and so they came out \nall wrong."
"Now his words encouraged Willem to join the coming adventure that\nwas heading his way, heading fast, in fact the adventure already\nsqueezed itself through a small key hole on the window frame."
"A large beetleman climbed in from the window. The beetleman was\ntall, taller than Willem's father, and rounder than his father as \nwell."
"The face of the beetleman was obscured. He wore a similar mask \nWillem's grandfather had worn in the war to avoid gas from melting\nhis eyes and burning his lungs."
"Turkilo, the beetleman had an urgent mission for Willem. You see\nthe ancient kingdom Turkilo came from was under a serious threat \nand Willem was the only boy who could help."
"Willem was a bit hesitant, but Turkilo was already forcing the\nboy out from his bedroom window out to the rain. 'We got no time\nfor thinkin' said Turkilo."
"The beetleman showed the way with his lantern, only Willem had\ntrouble keeping up with the pace as Turkilo flew fast deep inside\nthe Merwood with his man-beetle wings."
"Turkilo's lantern got more distant until Willem couldn't see it\nno more."
"Hopeless, and now lost in the woods he started crying, not unlike\nhow small song thrush chicks cry and beg for their mother for food."
"And just like that a giant song thrush grabbed Willem and took \nhim to a treetop nest full of chicks fighting for their place in \nthe world."
"Willem tried to beg for a tasty worm from the bird mother, but\ncompetition was fierce. Those chicks knew that to succeed in life\nyou have to push the competition over nest boundaries."
"Willem tried to struggle but ultimately fell off the nest. Just\nas he was about to meet his maker Turkilo scooped by him and grabbed\nWillem with his cold man-beetle arms."
"- The Tale of the Pocketcat - Chapter 2 -"
"Turkilo scolded Willem from wandering off. When Willem tried to\nexplain what had happened, that only aggravated the beetle man \neven more."
"To teach Willem a lesson, Turkilo kept pushing Willem deeper to\nthe forest with his freakish man-beetle strength."
"Willem slid down a muddy hill and found himself on large opening\nin the forest. In the middle of that opening two giant babyfaced\nblindworms were caught in a wrestling match."
"The two poor bastards fought each other with all they got. The\nbit each other, clawed each other, all while crying and wallowing\nloudly."
"Turkilo yelled from above that this is the nature of men, that\njust like those song thrush chicks from earlier, this would be\nWillem's future once he grew up to become an adult."
"Humans were ruthless in their pursuit for riches and wealth. Did\nWillem really want to take part in such fierce competition?"
"While the two talked, the other, the more ugly faced blindworm\nhad bested the other. Hungry for more devastation the thing set\nits eyes on Willem."
"It gave Willem a desperate chase. Turkilo just flew away cackling\n'This is what you wanted, right?'"
"Willem ran to a nearby thicket in hopes that the blindworm couldn't\nfit in there, instead the beast thrusted itself past broken branches\nwith ferocious force."
"Fat from eating his other babyfaced blindworm sibling, one \nparticularly sharp branch punctured the belly of the beast and\nfrom within hundreds of small blindworm babies spilled all over\nthe place."
"The little worms started wrestling and devouring each other the \nmoment they landed on the ground. Willem realized this is how the\ngiant babyfaced blindworms got so big to begin with."
"They kept eating each other until only one remained."
"For now it seemed like Willem was safe. It was not yet his turn \nto devour or be devoured. For some reason he did not feel comfortable\nthough. It felt like someone or something was keenly watching his\nevery move."
"He heard faint panting and rustling of leaves. Then he noticed \nthem, a pair of glowing eyes staring right at him from the darkness \nof shrubs and leaves."
"Willem did not like how the stare felt, panicked and ran to the\nopposite direction."
"Little did Willem know at the time, but what followed his every\nmove from behind the bush was the tall cat, the Pocketcat himse--"

His face... There's something that bothers you in his looks...\nSomething familiar.
It's smeared with makeup and blood... His expression is still \nfrozen in that shit-eating grin despite having gone through a \npainful death...
Beneath it all, there's something very familiar about him...\nYou don't want to even consider the possibility, but he reminds\nyou of your father-in-law, Eihner von Dutch...
But that's impossible. Isn't it?
Then again, you felt like you just saw the ghost of Elise as \nwell...
Your mind must be playing dirty tricks on you...
Needles is in top human form clearly. Under his garbs is a\nmuscular body full of scars. Some of the scars look like old burns\nand some look like old rash of some kind.
Because of his strong condition, he doesn't appear to have many\nweaknesses. Fire always works on his garbs though.

\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"Let's just go."
\>\i[67]\}AAN\{\<\n"I really need fresh air."
Elise...
The person looks to have a rather normal female body. A little bit\nmore muscular than usual perhaps, but nothing out of ordinary.
She has sewn her mouth partly shut and there appears to be more\nsewn cuts scattered around her body. Their purpose is unknown to\nyou, but they do distort her face beyond recognition.
But despite that... She eerily reminds you of someone...
The more you entertain the idea, the more certain you become of\nthis haunting realization.
No matter how disfigured her face would be, you would always\nrecognize your wife Elise... This woman has her appearance. You\nare 100% certain of this now.
But it's impossible. She is dead...
Either you are losing your mind slowly but surely, this place has\nfinally gotten the best of you... Or maybe there is some other\nsinister reasoning behind all this...
You hope that it is only your mind that is crumbling here...\nYou wish Elise has her rest now...
Because of the sewn cuts, the body is especially weak against\nslashing attacks that might open the cuts. Also blunt attacks\nmight open the stitches.
